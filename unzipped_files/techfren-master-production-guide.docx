**PART 1**

**VOICE & SCRIPTING**

**1.1 Your Voice DNA --- Discovery Energy**

Your voice is characterized by **real-time discovery**---you\'re not
performing excitement, you\'re genuinely discovering things alongside
your audience. This authenticity is your biggest asset.

**Key characteristics that define your voice:**

-   **Builder, not reviewer:** You don\'t just talk about tools---you
    use them live, react authentically, and show real results.

-   **Genuine reactions:** \"Dude,\" \"sick,\" \"whoa,\" \"that\'s
    actually perfect\"---these aren\'t scripted, they\'re your natural
    responses.

-   **Inclusive exploration:** \"Let\'s see,\" \"let\'s try this
    together\"---you bring viewers along on the journey.

-   **Accessible enthusiasm:** Complex AI topics made approachable
    through your excitement and clear explanations.

**Your Signature Vocabulary** (from 463 transcript analysis):

  ----------------- --------------- -----------------------------------------
  **Category**      **Frequency**   **Key Words/Phrases**

  Demo Starters     Very High       \"let\'s see\" (115), \"let\'s try\"
                                    (42), \"let\'s go\" (36), \"here we go\"
                                    (69)

  Reactions         High            \"cool\" (226), \"wow\" (54), \"dude\"
                                    (47), \"sick\" (24), \"boom\" (43)

  Approval          High            \"pretty cool\" (60), \"really cool\"
                                    (49), \"nice\" (63), \"perfect\" (54)

  Value Props       High            \"free\" (120), \"open source\" (67),
                                    \"local\" (67), \"fast\" (88), \"just\"
                                    (596)
  ----------------- --------------- -----------------------------------------

**1.2 The First 10 Words Rule**

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Your first 10 words determine whether people watch or
scroll. Script those first 10 words carefully.

**What the Data Shows** (from 157-video analysis):

-   **Bold claims in first 30 seconds:** Top performers 25% vs Bottom
    performers 8% (3x difference)

-   **Slow starts (\"so,\" \"hey,\" \"what\'s up\"):** Top performers 2%
    vs Bottom performers 10% (5x difference)

-   **Tool name in first 50 words:** Top performers 40% vs Bottom
    performers 25% (nearly 2x difference)

**Slow Start Warning**

**🚫 NEVER start with:** \"so,\" \"hey,\" \"what\'s up,\" \"alright
so,\" \"hey friends\"

*Examples that killed performance:*

-   50 views: \"Hey friends, it\'s been a huge week for AI coding,
    here\'s what happened.\"

-   130 views: \"so this stream we\'re looking into Toskate so they have
    agents\...\"

-   171 views: \"a lot of the time, these companies like Google,
    OpenAI\...\"

**Clarification: \"So\" as Transition vs Opener**

The word \"so\" correlates with high performers **when used mid-video**.
It\'s deadly **as your first word**.

-   **✓ GOOD:** \"openvoice has been trending\... **so** let\'s try it
    out\"

-   **✗ BAD:** \"**So** today we\'re looking at this new tool\...\"

**1.3 Hook Performance Ranking**

Based on 157-video analysis with view performance correlation:

  ----------------------- ----------- -----------------------------------
  **Hook Type**           **Success   **Verdict**
                          Rate**      

  **1. Bold Claim**       **80%**     ✓ USE --- Your #1 pattern

  2\. Excitement Reaction 57%         Good --- Natural for you

  3\. Direct Demo/Action  54%         Good --- Skip the preamble

  4\. Tool Introduction   50%         Neutral --- Better with claim

  5\. Question Hook       29%         ✗ AVOID --- Don\'t ask, claim
  ----------------------- ----------- -----------------------------------

**Your Highest-Performing Openings** (real examples):

**12,321 views:** *\"openvoice has been trending 20,000 stars instantly
clone any voice\...\"* Pattern: Trending claim + specific metric +
immediate value

**10,112 views:** *\"Now this is something I haven\'t seen in any other
voice assistant\...\"* Pattern: Unique discovery claim + curiosity gap

**8,842 views:** *\"Let\'s see, alternative of cursor, there\'s so many,
dude\...\"* Pattern: Direct action + authentic energy

**1.4 High-Performance Language Patterns**

Words that correlate with higher views (per 1,000 words):

**USE MORE:** \"so\" (+1.25), \"just\" (+0.88), \"actually\" (+0.87),
\"here\" (+0.84), \"cool\" (+0.76), \"look\" (+0.59)

**USE LESS:** \"like\" (-1.72 in high performers), \"I think\"
(-0.30)---these signal hesitation

**Key insight:** High performers use more confident, direct language
(\"so,\" \"just,\" \"actually\") while low performers use more
hedging/filler (\"like,\" \"I think\"). Be assertive.

**Sentence Pacing Rules**

High-performing content uses shorter sentences. Your data shows:

  ----------------------------------- ----------------- -----------------
  **Metric**                          **High            **Low
                                      Performers**      Performers**

  Average sentence length             **24.6 words**    28.4 words

  \% short sentences (\<8 words)      **33.4%**         29.4%
  ----------------------------------- ----------------- -----------------

**Takeaway:** Use more punchy sentences. Break up long explanations. One
thought per sentence. \"Let\'s see. Boom. There we go. That\'s actually
perfect.\"

**1.5 Script Structure Blueprint**

Based on your highest-performing content, here\'s the structure that
works:

  ----------------- ------------ -----------------------------------------
  **Section**       **Time**     **Purpose**

  HOOK              0-3 sec      Bold claim OR result preview. Lead with
                                 the discovery, not the backstory.

  VALUE STACK       3-10 sec     Hit 2-3 benefits rapidly: free, local, no
                                 code, fast, easy. Use \"just\" liberally.

  LIVE DEMO         10-45 sec    Show, don\'t explain. Use \"let\'s see\"
                                 and \"let\'s try\" to bring viewers
                                 along.

  REACTIONS         Throughout   \"Whoa,\" \"dude,\" \"that\'s actually
                                 perfect\"---your authentic reactions are
                                 content.

  CLOSE             Last 5 sec   Actionable CTA: \"download,\" \"check it
                                 out,\" \"give it a try.\" Skip
                                 \"subscribe.\"
  ----------------- ------------ -----------------------------------------

**PART 2**

**FIRESHIP-STYLE PRODUCTION**

**2.1 Core Principles & Pacing**

Fireship videos follow a core philosophy: *\"Your goal is to make the
best YOUTUBE videos possible. Not the best produced videos. Not the
funniest videos. Not the highest quality videos. It\'s to make the best
YOUTUBE videos possible.\"*

**For techfren:** This means optimizing for the platform, not for
production perfectionism. A scrappier video that hooks viewers beats a
polished video nobody watches. Your \"discovery energy\" voice already
aligns with this---authenticity over production value.

**Pacing Specifications**

  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  **Element**             **Specification**

  Speaking Rate           200-250 words per minute (normal conversation
                          is 120-150 wpm)

  Cuts Per Minute         10-15 visual cuts or transitions per minute

  Sentence Length         Short, punchy sentences. Average 10-15 words
                          maximum.

  Dead Air                Zero tolerance. Every pause is filled with
                          visual content.

  Video Length            Code Report: 4-6 minutes
  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------

**2.2 The Humor Framework**

Fireship\'s humor is the secret sauce that transforms dry tech content
into entertainment. It operates on distinct levels:

  ------------------ ----------------------- -----------------------------
  **Type**           **Description**         **Example**

  Dry/Deadpan        Stating absurd things   \"And of course, like every
                     with complete           startup, they\'re going to
                     seriousness. No change  change the world. By adding
                     in tone.                another JS framework to
                                             npm.\"

  Self-Deprecating   Making fun of himself   \"I have the personality of a
                     or his role. Creates    carrot and the face made for
                     relatability.           radio\...\"

  Niche/Inside Jokes Jokes only programmers  \"Yes, another JS framework.
                     understand. Creates     There are more JS frameworks
                     in-group feeling.       than developers.\"

  Sarcastic Hot      Exaggerated opinions    \"Web3 is going just great.\"
  Takes              delivered as obvious    (while showing crypto
                     facts.                  disasters)

  Meme References    Visual memes matching   Showing \"this is fine\" meme
                     narration tone.         when discussing production
                                             outage.
  ------------------ ----------------------- -----------------------------

**Joke Placement Strategy**

-   **First joke within 15-20 seconds** (rewards viewers for clicking)

-   **Meme/joke every 20-30 seconds** (maintains entertainment value)

-   **Callback jokes** to earlier references (creates satisfying
    connections)

-   **End on a memorable line** (leaves viewers with positive feeling)

**Writing Techniques**

**Contrast Technique:** State something serious, then immediately
undercut it.

*\"This revolutionary AI will transform the industry. By making
developers obsolete. But hey, at least we\'ll have more time for
therapy.\"*

**Absurdist Escalation:** Start reasonable, escalate to ridiculous.

*\"They raised 100 million dollars to build\... a todo app. But this one
uses blockchain. And AI. And it runs on Kubernetes. In space.\"*

**Deadpan Observation:** State obvious absurdities as if reporting
facts.

*\"The company promises their framework will solve all your problems.
Which is exactly what the last 47 frameworks promised.\"*

**2.3 Visual Language & Production**

**The Black Background Aesthetic**

Fireship\'s signature visual style uses a pure black (#000000)
background with content layered on top. This aligns perfectly with
techfren\'s existing Matrix-inspired brand aesthetic and creates high
contrast for code snippets and text.

**Visual Element Types**

  ----------------- ----------------------------- -----------------------
  **Element**       **Usage**                     **Source**

  Code Snippets     Appear with syntax            VS Code screenshots,
                    highlighting, zoom effects,   Carbon, Snappify
                    progressive reveal            

  Memes/GIFs        Reaction clips synced to      gifgrep, GIPHY, Tenor,
                    narration tone. Usually 2-4   movie/TV clips
                    seconds.                      

  Diagrams          Clean, simple architecture    Excalidraw, custom
                    diagrams or flowcharts        graphics, Mermaid

  Text Overlays     Key terms, stats, and         After Effects, Premiere
                    emphasis appear on screen     Pro titles

  Screenshots       Product UI, websites,         Direct capture with Ken
                    documentation, tweets         Burns effect
  ----------------- ----------------------------- -----------------------

**2.4 Video Structure Breakdown**

Fireship videos follow distinct segments, each with specific goals:

  ----------------- ----------- -----------------------------------------
  **Section**       **Time**    **Purpose & Elements**

  HOOK              0-5 sec     Newsreel-style title card + date.
                                Immediate bold claim or
                                attention-grabbing statement. Often
                                starts with \"It\'s \[date\], and
                                \[dramatic event\].\"

  CONTEXT           5-30 sec    Quick background on the topic. Establish
                                why viewers should care. First meme/joke
                                insertion here to reward early viewers.

  CORE CONTENT      30s-4min    Main explanation with rapid topic
                                transitions. Joke/meme every 15-30
                                seconds. Code snippets, diagrams, visual
                                aids constantly changing.

  CONCLUSION        4-5 min     Quick summary or hot take. Often ends
                                with sarcastic/ironic statement.
                                Signature outro: \"This has been the code
                                report.\"
  ----------------- ----------- -----------------------------------------

**MrBeast-Inspired Retention Principles**

-   **First minute is critical:** You win or lose most viewers here.
    Pre-plan it. Match your thumbnail promise immediately.

-   **Minutes 1-3 (Transition):** Stop telling people what they will be
    watching and start showing them.

-   **3-Minute re-engagement:** Include a \"spectacle\"---something
    impressive that only you can do.

-   **Back half content:** Once someone has watched 6 minutes, they\'re
    \"super invested.\" Longer explanations are acceptable here.

-   **Never signal the end:** Unless building to the payoff.

**PART 3**

**TEMPLATES & TOOLS**

**3.1 Script Notes Template System**

Script notes are sentence starters you glance at while recording.
They\'re not full scripts---just prompts to remind you what points to
hit. You finish each sentence naturally on camera, keeping your
authentic voice.

**Why It Works:**

-   Keeps your delivery natural (not memorized/robotic)

-   Ensures you hit all key points without forgetting

-   Easy to glance at while screen recording

-   Preserves your \"discovery energy\" voice

**How to Write Script Notes**

1.  **Start with the outcome.** What does the viewer walk away knowing?
    Write that first, then work backward.

2.  **Write sentence starters, not full sentences.** Each bullet is 3-6
    words that trigger the rest of the thought. You\'ll complete it
    naturally on camera.

3.  **Use ellipsis to signal continuation.** End each starter with
    \"\...\" so your brain knows to keep going.

4.  **Group by section with clear headers.** Bold section headers (HOOK,
    VALUE STACK, DEMO, CLOSE) so you can quickly find your place.

5.  **Keep it to one page.** If you can\'t see everything at once,
    you\'ll lose your place. Trim until it fits.

**Example Format**

**HOOK**

> • \[Result or bold claim\]\...
>
> • \[What this is\]\...

**VALUE STACK**

> • I use \[tool\] and\...
>
> • No \[pain point\]\...

**DEMO**

> • \[First action\]\...
>
> • Let\'s see if\...

**CLOSE**

> • \[Action CTA: try it, download, check it out\]\...

**3.2 Ready-to-Use Script Templates**

*Templates are ordered by performance data. Bold Claim templates lead.*

**Template 1: Bold Claim (Highest Performer --- 80% Success)**

**\[HOOK\]** \[Tool\] has been trending---\[specific metric\]. \[What it
does\]\... **\[VALUE STACK\]** It\'s \[free/open source/local\]. No
\[pain point\] required. **\[DEMO\]** Let\'s try it out. \[ACTION\].
Let\'s see if this works\... **\[REACTION\]** \[Dude/Whoa/Wow\], that\'s
actually \[perfect/sick/really cool\]. **\[CTA\]** Go download it /
Check it out / Give it a try.

**Example:** *\"openvoice has been trending---20,000 stars. Instantly
clone any voice. It\'s completely free and runs locally. Let\'s try it
out\...\"*

**Template 2: Social Proof Claim**

**\[HOOK\]** Someone said this is \[the best/beating X\], so let\'s try
it out\... **\[CONTEXT\]** This is \[TOOL\] and it supposedly \[CLAIM\].
**\[DEMO\]** Let\'s see if it actually works. \[TEST IT LIVE\].
**\[VERDICT\]** \[Honest reaction\]. \[One sentence summary\].

**Template 3: Unique Discovery**

**\[HOOK\]** Now this is something I haven\'t seen \[anywhere/in any
other tool\]\... **\[WHAT IT IS\]** \[TOOL\] can \[UNIQUE CAPABILITY\].
**\[DEMO\]** Let me show you. \[DEMONSTRATE\]. **\[CTA\]** Try it
yourself.

**Template 4: Insider Info**

**\[HOOK\]** \[Oh yeah/Did you see\] the \[leaked/new\] \[thing\]?
Pretty insane\... **\[REVEAL\]** \[Show/explain the insider info\].
**\[REACTION\]** \[Your genuine take on what it means\]. **\[CTA\]** Let
me know what you think.

**Template 5: Build Demo**

**\[HOOK\]** I just \[built/created\] \[RESULT\] with \[TOOL\].
**\[VALUE STACK\]** No \[downloads/installs/coding knowledge\] required.
Let me show you how. **\[DEMO\]** This was my prompt: \[SHOW PROMPT\].
And here\'s what it gave me\... **\[TIPS\]** My tip is to \[ACTIONABLE
ADVICE\]. **\[CTA\]** Try it yourself.

**3.3 GifGrep Skill --- Finding Memes & GIFs**

Use gifgrep to search GIF providers (Tenor/Giphy), download results, and
extract stills for use in Fireship-style content. This tool makes
finding reaction GIFs fast and scriptable.

**Quick Start Examples**

\# Search for GIFs and get URLs

gifgrep \"mind blown\" \--max 5 \--format url

\# Download a GIF directly

gifgrep \"celebration\" \--download \--max 1

\# Extract a still frame (for thumbnails)

gifgrep still ./clip.gif \--at 1.5s -o still.png

\# Create a contact sheet (grid of frames)

gifgrep sheet ./clip.gif \--frames 9 \--cols 3 -o sheet.png

**Common Workflows for Content Creation**

**Finding Reaction GIFs for Videos:**

gifgrep \"shocked\" \--max 10 \--format url gifgrep \"this is fine\"
\--max 5 gifgrep \"thumbs up\" \--download \--max 1

**Key Options:**

  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  **Option**        **Description**

  \--max N          Limit number of results

  \--format url     Output only URLs (pipe-friendly)

  \--json           Output full JSON with metadata

  \--download       Save GIF to \~/Downloads

  \--source         Choose provider: auto \| tenor \| giphy
  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------

**Integration with Fireship-Style Videos:**

Remember: Fireship uses a meme/GIF every 20-30 seconds. Build a library
of common reactions:

-   \"mind blown\" --- for impressive features

-   \"this is fine\" --- for bugs/disasters

-   \"confused math\" --- for complex concepts

-   \"celebration\" --- for successful demos

-   \"surprised pikachu\" --- for obvious outcomes

**PART 4**

**QUICK REFERENCE**

**4.1 Pre-Recording Checklist**

☐ Do I have a strong hook? (Bold claim \> Tool intro \> Question)

☐ Does my first word avoid \"so,\" \"hey,\" or \"what\'s up\"?

☐ Did I stack value props early? (free/local/fast/easy)

☐ Am I showing, not just telling?

☐ Is my CTA action-oriented? (download/try/check out)

☐ Will this be under 60 seconds? (for shorts)

☐ First joke appears within 20 seconds? (for Fireship-style)

☐ Meme/GIF planned every 20-30 seconds? (for Fireship-style)

☐ Visual changes every 3-6 seconds?

☐ Does this sound like me---not a generic take?

**4.2 Power Words Reference**

**Words to USE:**

\"just\" • \"free\" • \"open source\" • \"local\" • \"let\'s see\" •
\"let\'s try\" • \"actually\" • \"boom\" • \"dude\" • \"sick\" •
\"pretty cool\" • \"really cool\" • \"check it out\" • \"here\'s how\" •
\"trending\" • \"best\" • \"fastest\" • \"beats\"

**Reaction Words (let these happen naturally):**

\"wow\" • \"whoa\" • \"oh\" • \"nice\" • \"perfect\" • \"awesome\" •
\"that\'s actually\...\" • \"wait\" • \"interesting\"

**Transition Phrases:**

\"so\" (mid-video only!) • \"okay\" • \"alright\" • \"and then\" •
\"here we go\" • \"there we go\" • \"now\"

**Words to MINIMIZE:**

\"like\" (as filler) • \"I think\" • \"kind of\" • \"maybe\" •
\"subscribe\" • \"follow\" • \"so\" (as opener) • \"hey\" • \"what\'s
up\"

**4.3 The 7 Scripting Rules**

6.  **Lead with a claim, not context.** \"This is trending with 20K
    stars\" beats \"Let me show you this tool.\" Make the viewer curious
    about the claim before explaining it.

7.  **Never start with \"so,\" \"hey,\" or \"what\'s up.\"** These slow
    starts kill retention. Jump directly into value.

8.  **Name the tool in the first 5 seconds.** 40% of your top performers
    do this vs 25% of bottom. Specificity signals value immediately.

9.  **Use comparisons for credibility.** \"better than GPT-4\" appears
    in 18% of top videos vs 8% of bottom. Comparisons create instant
    context.

10. **Cut the filler words.** Your top videos have 14% fewer fillers
    (\"like,\" \"basically,\" \"you know\"). Script tightly.

11. **Don\'t ask---claim.** Question hooks have a 29% success rate. Bold
    claims have 80%. Make statements, not questions.

12. **\"Free\" and \"open source\" are magic words.** 2.5x more top
    performers mention these. They signal immediate value.

**4.4 CTA Performance Guide**

Not all CTAs are equal. Action-oriented CTAs massively outperform
engagement-ask CTAs:

  ----------------------- ----------------- -----------------------------
  **CTA Type**            **Avg Views**     **Recommendation**
