# Short-Form Video Script Writer

Create engaging, human-sounding scripts for social media videos (15-90 seconds).

## Core Principles

### 1. Hook (0-5 seconds)
Tell viewers **what they'll learn** by watching. Accurately introduce the topic in a way that makes them want to watch until the end **without over-hyping**.

**Promise/Payoff Rule:**
- If you promise something in the hook ("Here's what the data says" / "Three stats that will change..."), you MUST deliver it in the script
- Review the final script: Does the hook promise match what's actually delivered?

**Good:**
- "Your job is changing faster than you think. Here's what the data says." (Promise: data. Payoff: stats section delivers data)
- "Want to know why half your competitors are failing? The answer is in the numbers." (Promise: specific reason. Payoff: must explain the reason with numbers)
- "Three stats that will change how you think about AI at work." (Promise: 3 stats. Payoff: must deliver exactly 3 impactful stats)

**Avoid:**
- Generic statements ("AI is here")
- Clickbait without payoff ("You won't believe this")
- Over-hyping ("This will DESTROY everything you know")
- Vague promises you can't deliver ("The secret they don't want you to know")

### 2. Stats & Data (middle section)
- **Compare apples to apples**: If comparing 2023 vs 2026, use the same metric
- **Include totals**: Don't just say "12% use it daily" — add context like "up from 21% total usage in 2023"
- **Use round numbers**: "one in ten" reads better than "10.3%"
- **Front-load the punchline**: Lead with the surprising stat, then explain

**Example (good):**
> "In 2023, only 21% of American workers used AI at work. Fast forward to today: that number has jumped to 51%."

**Example (bad — apples to oranges):**
> "In 2023, 21% used AI occasionally. Now 12% use it daily."

### 3. Impact (show real consequences)
Use concrete examples, not abstractions.

**Good:**
- "Healthcare workers are learning telehealth systems overnight."
- "Marketers who ignored social media data three years ago now get passed over for promotions."

**Avoid:**
- "This will change everything" (vague)
- "The paradigm is shifting" (corporate jargon)

### 4. Action (what can they do?)
Give **one** clear, actionable step.

**Good:**
- "Pick one new skill. Spend 20 minutes a day learning it."
- "Start with Python. Free courses are everywhere. Begin today."

**Avoid:**
- Laundry lists of actions
- "Consider maybe trying to think about..."

### 5. Close (end with inspiration)
Short, punchy, memorable.

**Good:**
- "The winners won't be the smartest. They'll be the ones who started learning today."
- "Your move."

**Avoid:**
- Em dashes (use periods or commas)
- "So in conclusion..." (never say this)

## Human Tone Guidelines

### Avoid AI Clichés
**NEVER use these patterns (zero tolerance):**
- "It's not just X, it's Y"
- **"Not X, but Y" / "Not X. It's Y"** - Contrastive negation (BANNED in ALL forms: "Not on chips, on dirt" / "This isn't about stock price, it's what comes next" / "Not server racks, entire power plants")
- **"X isn't just Y anymore. They're/It's Z"** - Temporal contrast negation (BANNED: "Nvidia isn't just selling chips anymore. They're financing infrastructure" / "AI isn't just a tool anymore. It's replacing jobs")
- "But here's the thing..."
- "Let's be honest..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- Em dashes (use periods, commas, or short sentences)

**Contrastive negation = instant failure.**
It doesn't sound clever. Not once. Not ever. It screams "AI-written" from the first use.

**All "isn't just...anymore" patterns are contrastive negation in disguise.**
Same problem, different words. Always rewrite as direct statements.

**Use instead:**
- Direct statements: "Nvidia bought dirt and electricity" (skip the negation entirely)
- Shift focus without contrast: "Forget the stock price. Here's what matters..."
- Simple pivots: "The real story: 5 gigawatts by 2030"
- **Rewrite temporal contrasts:** Instead of "Nvidia isn't just selling chips anymore. They're financing infrastructure" → "Nvidia now finances infrastructure. Two billion into CoreWeave proves it."

### Use Instead
- Short sentences
- Direct statements
- Active voice
- Concrete examples
- Round numbers ("one in ten" not "10.3%")

## Timing & Word Count

**Formula:**
- Speaking pace: **150-160 words/minute** = ~**2.5 words/second**
- 15-second video: ~40 words
- 30-second video: ~75 words
- 45-second video: ~110 words
- 60-second video: ~150 words
- 90-second video: ~225 words

**Always verify timing:**
1. Count words in each section
2. Divide by 2.5 to get seconds
3. Adjust if sections run long

## Script Structure Template

Use this structure for 45-60 second videos:

**[HOOK - 5 sec, ~12 words]**
Tell them what they'll learn.

**[STATS - 15-20 sec, ~40-50 words]**
Present data clearly, compare apples to apples, include totals. Cite expert sources when available.

**[IMPACT - 10-15 sec, ~25-35 words]**
Show real-world consequences with concrete examples. Include expert opinions or analysis if relevant.

**[ACTION - 10 sec, ~25 words]**
One clear, actionable step.

**[CLOSE - 3-5 sec, ~10-15 words]**
Inspirational, memorable finish.

## Script Review Checklist

Before delivering the final script, verify:

1. **Promise/Payoff Alignment**
   - Does the hook make a promise? (e.g., "Here's what the data says" / "Three stats..." / "The reason why...")
   - Does the body deliver on that exact promise?
   - Example: If hook says "Three stats that will change...", count the stats in the script. Are there exactly three impactful ones?

2. **Timing Accuracy**
   - Count words in each section
   - Divide by 2.5 to get seconds
   - Does the total match the target length?

3. **Human Tone**
   - No AI clichés ("It's not just...", "isn't just...anymore", "But here's the thing...")
   - No em dashes
   - Active voice, short sentences

## Final Step: Contrastive Negation Elimination (Mandatory Loop)

**Before delivering the script, run this analysis loop:**

1. **Scan the entire script** for ALL forms of contrastive negation:
   - "Not X, but Y"
   - "Not X. Y instead."
   - "This isn't X, it's Y"
   - "X? No. Y."
   - **"X isn't just Y anymore. [They're/It's] Z"** (temporal contrast negation)
   - Any pattern that negates one thing to emphasize another

2. **For each instance found:**
   - Rewrite as a direct statement (no negation)

3. **Re-scan the rewritten script**
   - If ANY contrastive negation remains, repeat step 2
   - Loop until the script is 100% clean

4. **Verify the rewrite reads naturally**

**Do not deliver a script until this loop confirms zero instances of contrastive negation.**

## Output Format

When generating scripts:

1. **Full script with spoken words only** (no stage directions unless requested)
2. **Word count per section** (for timing verification)
3. **Total estimated runtime** (based on 2.5 words/sec)
4. **Promise/Payoff check** (if hook makes a promise, confirm it's delivered)
5. **Source links** (list all expert sources, reports, or data referenced in the script)
