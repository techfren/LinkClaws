## Health Documents

**2026-01-27:** Organized personal health documents into `/health/` directory:

```
health/
├── profiles/
│   ├── beliefs-profile.md      # Personal beliefs (Dec 2024)
│   ├── values-profile.md       # Core values & priorities
│   └── nutrition-profile.md    # Supplements, diet breakdown
├── journal/
│   ├── highlights.md           # Journal highlights & reflections
│   ├── notes-archive.md        # Combined historical notes
│   ├── read.md                 # Reading notes
│   └── takeaways.md            # Key learnings
└── reference/
    └── longevity-fitness-guide.pdf  # Longevity guide
```

Key insights captured:
- Beliefs profile identifies commitment paralysis loop (waiting for certainty)
- Values emphasize autonomy, mastery, authentic creation
- Nutrition: Blueprint Longevity Mix + whole foods diet, minimal gaps
- Goal: Financial independence (~60k/year) for time sovereignty
- Target: July 2026 inflection point when visa constraint lifts

## Strategic Research Archive (2026-01-28)

Comprehensive research compiled for AJ (techfren) planning:

| Document | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `memory/AJ_PROFILE.md` | Full profile, Augment Code role, E-3 visa status, projects, audience metrics |
| `memory/MARKET_LANDSCAPE.md` | DevTools/AI landscape, 550+ companies mapped, competitor analysis, trends |
| `memory/DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY.md` | Content distribution across platforms, monetization models, indie hacker patterns |
| `memory/VISA_CONSTRAINTS.md` | E-3 restrictions, workarounds, spouse authorization, transition paths |
| `memory/PROJECT_PORTFOLIO.md` | All 6 projects analyzed with positioning, opportunities, synergies |

**Key Findings:**
- **SpeakMCP** already has Agent Skills + Personas built in - opportunity is **positioning** as personal assistant platform, not rebuilding
- Chaos Coder: Many open source v0 alternatives exist; differentiation is multi-variation approach
- Visa limits active business operation but GitHub Sponsors + content monetization likely safe
- Spouse work authorization (E-3D) = potential business structure workaround
- Market: 92% developers use AI daily; Agent Skills > MCP trend emerging
- Distribution: 150k+ followers, millions of views, cross-platform presence

## Autonomy Update (2026-02-01)

Updated AGENTS.md with new operating model:
- **95/5 Rule:** Work autonomously 95% of the time, ask questions only 5%
- **Deep work mode:** Checkout branches, run code, write comments, create issues/PRs
- **Full permissions:** Act with confidence, default to action
- **Always-active task:** Maintain at least one workstream at all times
