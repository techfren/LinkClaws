Description
===========

Object Storage links create the relationship between a directory in an
File Storage with Lustre file system and a path within an Object
Storage bucket. For more information, see Syncing Lustre file systems
with Object Storage.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you’re not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you’re
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
