Accepted values are:

   ADB, AIDATAPLATFORM, DATAFLOW, GENAI, GGCS, OBJECTSTORAGE, OKE, OMK

--stack-id [text]

The OCID of the Stack.

--stack-templates [text]

List of templates where artifacts are to be deployed for the stack.

Optional Parameters
===================

--adb [complex type]

ADB artifact details if adb is included in the services.

This option is a JSON list with items of type AdbArtifactsDetail.  For
documentation on AdbArtifactsDetail please see our API reference: htt
ps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/stack/20250830/datatypes/AdbArtif
actsDetail. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as
a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--dataflow [complex type]

Dataflow artifact details if dataflow is included in the services.

This option is a JSON list with items of type DataflowArtifactsDetail.
For documentation on DataflowArtifactsDetail please see our API
reference: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/stack/20250830/data
types/DataflowArtifactsDetail. This is a complex type whose value must
be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command
line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource
and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, CANCELLED, CANCELLING, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, NEEDS_ATTENTION, SUCCEEDED, WAITING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]
