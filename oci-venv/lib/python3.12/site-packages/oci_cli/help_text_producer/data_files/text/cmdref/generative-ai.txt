Description
===========

OCI Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of
state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover
a wide range of use cases for text generation, summarization, and text
embeddings.

Use the Generative AI service management CLI to create and manage
dedicated AI clusters, endpoints, custom models, and work requests in
the Generative AI service. For example, create a custom model by fine-
tuning an out-of-the-box model using your own data, on a fine-tuning
dedicated AI cluster. Then, create a hosting dedicated AI cluster with
an endpoint to host your custom model.

To access your custom model endpoints, or to try the out-of-the-box
models to generate text, summarize, and create text embeddings see the
[Generative AI Inference CLI].

To learn more about the service, see the Generative AI documentation.
