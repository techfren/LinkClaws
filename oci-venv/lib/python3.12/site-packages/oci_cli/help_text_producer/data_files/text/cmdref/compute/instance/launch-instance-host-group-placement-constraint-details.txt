Description
===========

Creates a new instance in the specified compartment and the specified
availability domain. For general information about instances, see
Overview of the Compute Service.

For information about access control and compartments, see Overview of
the IAM Service.

For information about availability domains, see Regions and
Availability Domains. To get a list of availability domains, use the
*ListAvailabilityDomains* operation in the Identity and Access
Management Service API.

All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an
Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).
When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You
can also retrieve a resource’s OCID by using a List API operation on
that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.

To launch an instance using an image or a boot volume use the
*sourceDetails* parameter in LaunchInstanceDetails.

When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual
network interface card (VNIC), called the *primary VNIC*. The VNIC has
a private IP address from the subnet’s CIDR. You can either assign a
private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign
one. You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To
retrieve the addresses, use the ListVnicAttachments operation to get
the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call GetVnic with the VNIC ID.

You can later add secondary VNICs to an instance. For more
information, see Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs).

To launch an instance from a Marketplace image listing, you must
provide the image ID of the listing resource version that you want,
but you also must subscribe to the listing before you try to launch
the instance. To subscribe to the listing, use the
GetAppCatalogListingAgreements operation to get the signature for the
terms of use agreement for the desired listing resource version. Then,
call CreateAppCatalogSubscription with the signature. To get the image
ID for the LaunchInstance operation, call
GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion.

When launching an instance, you may provide the *securityAttributes*
parameter in LaunchInstanceDetails to manage security attributes via
the instance, or in the embedded CreateVnicDetails to manage security
attributes via the VNIC directly, but not both.  Providing
*securityAttributes* in both locations will return a 400 Bad Request
response.

To determine whether capacity is available for a specific shape before
you create an instance, use the CreateComputeCapacityReport operation.

Avoid entering confidential information.

--extended-metadata [complex type]

Additional metadata key/value pairs that you provide. They serve the
same purpose and functionality as fields in the *metadata* object.

They are distinguished from *metadata* fields in that these can be
nested JSON objects (whereas *metadata* fields are string/string maps
only).

The combined size of the *metadata* and *extendedMetadata* objects can
be a maximum of 32,000 bytes. This is a complex type whose value must
be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command

example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--fault-domain [text]

A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an
availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault
domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they
are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability
domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that
affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault
domains.

If you do not specify the fault domain, the system selects one for
you.

   To get a list of fault domains, use the ListFaultDomains operation
   in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

Example:

   FAULT-DOMAIN-1

--freeform-tags [complex type]

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--hostname-label [text]

Deprecated. Instead use *hostnameLabel* in CreateVnicDetails. If you
provide both, the values must match.

--image-id [text]

Deprecated. Use *sourceDetails* with InstanceSourceViaImageDetails
source type instead. If you specify values for both, the values must
match.

--instance-configuration-id [text]

The OCID of the Instance Configuration containing instance launch
details. Any other fields supplied in this instance launch request
will override the details stored in the Instance Configuration for
this instance launch.

--instance-options [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--ipxe-script-file [filename]

This is an advanced option.

When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware
that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to
continue the boot process.

If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your
own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots. Be aware
that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots, not
only after the initial LaunchInstance call.

The default iPXE script connects to the instance’s local boot volume
over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE
script and want to network-boot from the instance’s local boot volume
over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, use the following
iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN:
iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

If your instance boot volume attachment type is paravirtualized, the
boot volume is attached to the instance through virtio-scsi and no
iPXE script is used. If your instance boot volume attachment type is
paravirtualized and you use custom iPXE to network boot into your
instance, the primary boot volume is attached as a data volume through
virtio-scsi drive.

For more information about the Bring Your Own Image feature of Oracle
Cloud Infrastructure, see Bring Your Own Image.

For more information about iPXE, see http://ipxe.org.

--is-ai-enterprise-enabled [boolean]

Whether to enable AI enterprise on the instance.

--is-pv-encryption-in-transit-enabled [boolean]

Whether to enable in-transit encryption for the data volume’s
paravirtualized attachment. This field applies to both block volumes
and boot volumes. The default value is false.

--launch-options [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--metadata [complex type]

Custom metadata key/value pairs that you provide, such as the SSH
public key required to connect to the instance.

A metadata service runs on every launched instance. The service is an
HTTP endpoint listening on 169.254.169.254. You can use the service
to:

* Provide information to Cloud-Init   to be used for various system
  initialization tasks.

* Get information about the instance, including the custom metadata
  that you   provide when you launch the instance.

   **Providing Cloud-Init Metadata**

   You can use the following metadata key names to provide information
   to  Cloud-Init:

   **“ssh_authorized_keys”** - Provide one or more public SSH keys to
   be  included in the *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* file for the default
   user on the  instance. Use a newline character to separate multiple
   keys. The SSH  keys must be in the format necessary for the
   *authorized_keys* file, as shown  in the example below.

   **“user_data”** - Provide your own base64-encoded data to be used
   by  Cloud-Init to run custom scripts or provide custom Cloud-Init
   configuration. For  information about how to take advantage of user
   data, see the  Cloud-Init Documentation.

   **Metadata Example**

      “metadata” : {          “quake_bot_level” : “Severe”,
      “ssh_authorized_keys” : “ssh-rsa <your_public_SSH_key>== rsa-
      key-20160227”,          “user_data” : “<your_public_SSH_key>==”
      }  **Getting Metadata on the Instance**

   To get information about your instance, connect to the instance
   using SSH and issue any of the  following GET requests:

      curl -H “Authorization: Bearer Oracle”
      http://169.254.169.254/opc/v2/instance/      curl -H
      “Authorization: Bearer Oracle”
      http://169.254.169.254/opc/v2/instance/metadata/      curl -H
      “Authorization: Bearer Oracle”
      http://169.254.169.254/opc/v2/instance/metadata/<any-key-name>

   You’ll get back a response that includes all the instance
   information; only the metadata information; or  the metadata
   information for the specified key name, respectively.

   The combined size of the *metadata* and *extendedMetadata* objects
   can be a maximum of 32,000 bytes.
