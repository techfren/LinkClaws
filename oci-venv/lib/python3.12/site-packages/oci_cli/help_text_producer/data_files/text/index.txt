Interactive Features
====================

OCI CLI offers interactive features to guide you through command
usage.

Enabling them allows:
   * Suggestions and autocompletion to help compose commands;

   * Color-coded suggestions to distinguish required parameters from
     optional parameters where required parameters are also
     highlighted with (*) for accessibility support; and

   * Quick references display alongside suggestions to recognize
     command and parameter purposes.

Try the interactive features anytime with the "-i" option:

   oci -i
