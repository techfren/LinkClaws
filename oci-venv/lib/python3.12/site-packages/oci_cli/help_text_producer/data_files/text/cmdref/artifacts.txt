artifacts
*********


Description
===========

Use the Artifacts and Container Images CLI to manage container images
and non-container generic artifacts.

* For container images such as Docker images, use the ContainerImage
  resource. Save the images in a container repository.

* For non-container generic artifacts or blobs, use the
  GenericArtifact resource. Save the artifacts in an artifact
  repository.

* To upload and download non-container generic artifacts, instead of
  the Artifacts and Container Images CLI, use the Generic Artifacts
  Content CLI.

For more information, see the user guides for Container Registry and
Artifact Registry.
