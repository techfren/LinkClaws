database. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as
a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

supported.

Accepted values are:

   DW, OLTP

--display-name [text]

The display name of the Globally distributed autonomous database.

--listener-port [integer]

The listener port number for the Globally distributed autonomous
database. The listener port number has to be unique for a customer
tenancy across all distributed autonomous databases. Same port number
should not be re-used for any other distributed autonomous database.

used for any other distributed autonomous database.

--ons-port-remote [integer]

Ons remote port number for Globally distributed autonomous database.
The onsPortRemote has to be unique for a customer tenancy across all
distributed autonomous databases. Same port number should not be re-
used for any other distributed autonomous database.

--prefix [text]

Unique name prefix for the Globally distributed autonomous databases.
Only alpha-numeric values are allowed. First character has to be a
letter followed by any combination of letter and number.

--private-endpoint-ids [complex type]

The collection of OCID of the private endpoint associated with
Globally distributed autonomous database. This is a complex type whose
value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the
command line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file
syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--shard-details [complex type]

Collection of shards for the Globally distributed autonomous database.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--sharding-method [text]

Sharding Methods for the Globally distributed autonomous database.

Accepted values are:

   SYSTEM, USER


Optional Parameters
===================

--chunks [integer]

Number of chunks in a shardspace. The value of chunks must be greater
than 2 times the size of the largest shardgroup in any shardspace.
Chunks is required to be provided for distributed autonomous databases
being created with SYSTEM shardingMethod. For USER shardingMethod,
chunks should not be set in create payload.

--db-backup-config [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. Example: *{“foo-namespace”: {“bar-key”: “value”}}* This is
a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be
provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name,
type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: *{“bar-
key”: “value”}* This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON.
The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in
as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id –> compartmentId),
while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before
using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command
option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a
JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our “using CLI with
advanced JSON options” link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--listener-port-tls [integer]

The TLS listener port number for Globally distributed autonomous
database. The TLS listener port number has to be unique for a customer
tenancy across all distributed autonomous databases. Same port number
should not be re-used for any other distributed autonomous database.
The listenerPortTls is mandatory for dedicated infrastructure based
distributed autonomous databases.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--replication-factor [integer]

The Replication factor for RAFT replication based Globally distributed
autonomous database. Currently supported values are 3, 5 and 7.

--replication-method [text]

The Replication method for Globally distributed autonomous database.
Use RAFT for Raft based replication. With RAFT replication, shards
cannot have peers details set on them. In case shards need to have
peers, please do not set RAFT replicationMethod. For all non RAFT
replication cases (with or without peers), please set
replicationMethod as DG or do not set any value for replicationMethod.

Accepted values are:

   DG, RAFT

--replication-unit [integer]

The replication unit count for RAFT based distributed autonomous
database. For RAFT replication based Globally distributed autonomous
database, the value should be at least twice the number of shards.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource
and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, CANCELED, CANCELING, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, NEEDS_ATTENTION, SUCCEEDED, WAITING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the work request
has reached the state defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 30
seconds.

Example using required parameter
================================

Copy and paste the following example into a JSON file, replacing the
example parameters with your own.

       oci distributed-database distributed-autonomous-db-service distributed-autonomous-database create --generate-param-json-input catalog-details > catalog-details.json
       oci distributed-database distributed-autonomous-db-service distributed-autonomous-database create --generate-param-json-input private-endpoint-ids > private-endpoint-ids.json
       oci distributed-database distributed-autonomous-db-service distributed-autonomous-database create --generate-param-json-input shard-details > shard-details.json

Copy the following CLI commands into a file named example.sh. Run the
command by typing “bash example.sh” and replacing the example
parameters with your own.

Please note this sample will only work in the POSIX-compliant bash-
like shell. You need to set up the OCI configuration and appropriate
