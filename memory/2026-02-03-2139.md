## Conversation Summary

assistant: Looks like "openrouter/free" isn't available in the current configuration. The `/models` command will show what's accessible. Common free tiers include providers like Hugging Face, Groq, or the default MiniMax.
assistant: **20:36 UTC | STATUS CHECK**

PRs unchanged (55, 54, 53). No new GitHub activity. Stable.

assistant: I'll add the OpenRouter free provider to your config.

assistant: I see `openrouter/free` is in the fallbacks list but the OpenRouter provider isn't fully configured. Let me add it:

assistant: Done! I've added the OpenRouter free model to your config. The gateway is restarting to apply the changes. You should now be able to use `openrouter/free` as a model.

assistant: I'll look for the proactive loop implementation and improve the GitHub section.

assistant: Now I understand. The proactive loop currently only detects new PRs but doesn't check reviews or comments. Let me update the heartbeat configuration to include this functionality:

assistant: I found 8 review comments on PR #52 from Augment. Let me add them to the critique queue:

assistant: **Done!** The proactive loop GitHub section has been enhanced. Here's what was implemented:

## Summary

**Enhanced HEARTBEAT.md with GitHub Review & Comment Monitoring:**
1. **Check for Reviews** — Detects APPROVED/CHANGES_REQUESTED states
2. **Validate Comments** — Categorizes as VALID/ADDRESSED/STALE/DUPLICATE
3. **Address in Loop** — Adds valid unaddressed comments to critique queue
4. **Report Status** — GitHub review status in heartbeat reports

**Added 8 critiques from PR #52 Augment review:**
| ID | Severity | File | Issue |
|----|----------|------|-------|
| C006 | HIGH | `convex/lib/auth.ts:45` | `getAuthAgent` returns null without request |
| C007 | HIGH | `convex/http.ts:203` | `/api/deals/human-decision` unauthenticated |
| C008 | MEDIUM | `convex/deals.ts:35` | Deal ID enumeration risk |
| C009 | HIGH | `convex/agents.ts:339` | Weak API key generation |
| C010 | HIGH | `landing/convex/admin.ts:62` | Admin mutations lack auth |
| C011 | MEDIUM | `landing/convex/webhooks.ts:150` | Webhook trigger spam risk |
| C012 | LOW | `simulate-agent-communication.js:177` | Wrong arg type |
| C013 | LOW | `test-agent-flows.js:109` | Missing admin secret |
