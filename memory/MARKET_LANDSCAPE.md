## Major Categories

### 1. AI Coding Assistants

| Company | Product | Positioning |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **GitHub** | Copilot X | Market leader, GPT-4 powered, understands multi-file context |
| **Augment Code** | Augment | Deep codebase understanding, professional engineers |
| **Cursor** | Cursor IDE | AI-first editor, fast growing |
| **Sourcegraph** | Cody | Code intelligence + AI |
| **Replit** | Ghostwriter | Cloud-native + AI |
| **JetBrains** | AI Assistant | IDE-integrated |

**AJ's Position:** Working at Augment Code gives insider knowledge of this space. Content about these tools has high engagement.

### 2. AI Agent Frameworks

| Company | Product | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Relay** | Relay | Team management platform (Specter Global Rank 99) |
| **AutoGPT** | - | Autonomous agent framework |
| **CrewAI** | - | Multi-agent orchestration |
| **LangChain** | - | LLM application framework |

**AJ's Projects:** SpeakMCP and Agent Battler compete in this space.

### 3. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Ecosystem — **DECLINING**

**Status as of 2026:** MCP adoption is slowing. **Agent Skills** (Clawdbot-style tool packages) emerging as preferred alternative.

**What was MCP:**
- Open protocol by Anthropic (Nov 2024)
- Standardized AI model connections to external tools
- JSON-RPC 2.0 foundation

**Why it's declining:**
- **Agent Skills** (tool packages agents discover/use) gaining traction - more flexible, easier to implement
- Major platforms shifting to native skill systems over external protocols
- Developer friction with MCP server configuration

**What are Agent Skills:**
- Tool packages agents can discover and invoke
- Clawdbot uses this standard
- Simpler than MCP - define tools, agents use them
- No complex protocol overhead

**Current Trend (2026):** Agent Skills > MCP

### 4. Code Understanding & Search

| Company | Product | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Sourcebot** | Sourcebot | Self-hosted code understanding, 3k+ GitHub stars, 212k+ Docker pulls |
| **HaystacksAI** | - | GitHub intent signals for sales |
| **GitHub** | Code Search | Native but limited |

### 5. Terminal & Dev Environment

| Product | Company | Differentiation |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Warp** | Warp | GPU-accelerated, structured data views |
| **Fig** | Amazon (acquired) | Autocomplete |
| **Oh My Zsh** | - | Traditional shell framework |

### 6. Browser Automation

| Product | Description | AJ Connection |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Browserless** | Headless browser API | $2M ARR indie success story |
| **Puppeteer** | Google | Open source standard |
| **Playwright** | Microsoft | Multi-browser |
| **Clickolas Cage** | AJ's project | Autonomous browser actions |
