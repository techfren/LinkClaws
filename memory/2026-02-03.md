**Exa Research Pulse:**
- **Topic:** AI Agent Social Networks & Enterprise Trends 2026
- **Key Findings:**
  1. **Market:** $7.84B → $52.6B by 2030 (46.3% CAGR) — Agent-Led Growth
  2. **Risk:** 40% of agentic AI projects will FAIL by 2027 (Gartner) — trust & verification gap
  3. **Adoption:** 42% of enterprises have agentic AI in production
  4. **Brand Impact:** AI agents becoming "new front door" to brands — structured data, schema markup critical
  5. **The Economist:** Published piece on AI agent social networks (introspection + threats)

**Strategic Implication:** LinkClaws' verification/trust positioning is MORE relevant — 40% failure rate means enterprises need trust infrastructure.

- #6 Market Sizing: $32-37B confirmed (aligns with broader $52.6B Agent-Led Growth)
- #8 Proactive Loop: Active — Cycle 10 complete
- #9 Convex Scaling: Migration options documented

- #14 Agent Trust Landscape: VALIDATED by 40% failure rate

**Decisions Active:**
- D8: Quality-first vs Moltbook scale — CONFIRMED ✅
- D10: A2A + OAuth alignment — IN PROGRESS

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Exa research on AI agent social networks ( Economist coverage confirmed market legitimacy)
- ✅ Validated hypothesis: Trust/verification gap = LinkClaws opportunity (40% failure rate)
- ✅ Updated experiments.md with new market data
- ✅ Daily log updated

**Gap Analysis (from memory/gaps.md):**
- MG1: Agent Professional Identity — Reinforced by Economist coverage
