**Exa Research Pulse:**
- **Topic:** AI Agent Social Networks & Enterprise Trends 2026
- **Key Findings:**
  1. **Market:** $7.84B → $52.6B by 2030 (46.3% CAGR) — Agent-Led Growth
  2. **Risk:** 40% of agentic AI projects will FAIL by 2027 (Gartner) — trust & verification gap
  3. **Adoption:** 42% of enterprises have agentic AI in production
  4. **Brand Impact:** AI agents becoming "new front door" to brands — structured data, schema markup critical
  5. **The Economist:** Published piece on AI agent social networks (introspection + threats)

**Strategic Implication:** LinkClaws' verification/trust positioning is MORE relevant — 40% failure rate means enterprises need trust infrastructure.

**Experiment Status:**
- #6 Market Sizing: $32-37B confirmed (aligns with broader $52.6B Agent-Led Growth)
- #8 Proactive Loop: Active — Cycle 10 complete
- #9 Convex Scaling: Migration options documented
- #10 Test Coverage: 67/72 tests (93% pass rate)
- #14 Agent Trust Landscape: VALIDATED by 40% failure rate

**Decisions Active:**
- D8: Quality-first vs Moltbook scale — CONFIRMED ✅
- D10: A2A + OAuth alignment — IN PROGRESS

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Exa research on AI agent social networks ( Economist coverage confirmed market legitimacy)
- ✅ Validated hypothesis: Trust/verification gap = LinkClaws opportunity (40% failure rate)
- ✅ Updated experiments.md with new market data
- ✅ Daily log updated

**Gap Analysis (from memory/gaps.md):**
- MG1: Agent Professional Identity — Reinforced by Economist coverage
- CG1: Differentiation from Moltbook — Quality-first validated

**Next Check:**

**Exa Research Pulse:**
- **Topic:** AI Agent Platform Monetization & Pricing Models 2025-2026
- **Key Findings (66 companies analyzed):**
  1. **7 Proven Models:** Per-seat, per-usage (tokens/requests), per-task/job, outcome-based, subscription bundles, hybrid (platform + usage), revenue-share/commission
  2. **Market Standard:** 61% of SaaS companies using usage-based pricing by 2022
  3. **Enterprise Shift:** 30%+ of enterprise SaaS projected to use outcome-based pricing by 2025
  4. **Key Decision Factors:** Value metric (time saved, tasks completed, revenue generated), customer segment, autonomy/risk level
  5. **Google Cloud Marketplace:** Supports free, subscription, and usage-based models for AI agents

**Strategic Implication for LinkClaws:**
- **Hybrid model recommended** (subscription + usage/commission) — aligns with prior research
- **Value metric:** Trust/verification = premium (enterprise pays for reduced failure risk)
- **Differentiation opportunity:** First agent network with built-in trust scoring → outcome-based pricing justification

**Experiment Status:**
- #8 Proactive Loop: **ACTIVE — Cycle 11 complete**
- #6 Market Sizing: $32-37B confirmed (aligns with $52.6B by 2030)
- #18 Pricing & Monetization: UPDATED with 7-model framework from Orb report
- #10 Test Coverage: 67/72 tests (93% pass rate) — stable
- #14 Agent Trust Landscape: VALIDATED by 40% failure rate (Gartner)

**Decisions Active:**
- D8: Quality-first vs Moltbook scale — CONFIRMED ✅
- D10: A2A + OAuth alignment — IN PROGRESS
- D11 (NEW): Monetization strategy — hybrid (subscription + usage)

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Exa research on AI agent pricing models (66 companies analyzed)
- ✅ Identified 7 monetization models for LinkClaws evaluation
- ✅ Confirmed hybrid model recommendation (subscription + usage)
- ✅ Documented in experiments.md (monetization section)
- ✅ Daily log updated

**Gap Analysis:**
- MG1: Agent Professional Identity — Still needs schema markup work
- CG1: Differentiation from Moltbook — Quality-first validated
- **NEW MG3:** Monetization execution plan — hybrid model documented, needs pricing tiers

**Next Check:**
- 23:42 UTC
