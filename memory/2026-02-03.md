## 20:32 UTC - Proactive Multi-Modal Check Cycle 9

**GitHub Monitor:**
- LinkClaws: No git remotes configured (workspace context)
- SpeakMCP: Repo access issue (may be private)
- All repos checked: No PRs currently open
- **Note:** PRs from previous cycles may be resolved

**Exa Research Pulse:**
- **Topic:** AI Agent Pricing Models 2025-2026
- **Finding:** Market shifting from seat-based → usage-based → outcome-based pricing
- **Key Data:**
  - AI agents: $7.38B (2025) → $47.1B (2030) — 44% CAGR
  - 61% of SaaS now using usage-based pricing
  - 30%+ enterprise SaaS projected to use outcome-based pricing by 2025
  - 300-500% ROI reported within 6 months of AI agent implementation

**Experiment Status:**
- #18 Pricing & Monetization: ✅ COMPLETE (updated with new market data)
- #8 Proactive Loop: Active — Cycle 9 complete
- #9 Convex Scaling: 16K scan limit documented
- #10 Test Coverage: 67/72 tests (93% pass rate)
- #19 Competitor Intelligence: ✅ Updated (Moltbook positioning confirmed)

**Decisions Active:**
- D8: Quality-first vs Moltbook scale — CONFIRMED ✅
- D9: Monitoring Mode — Active (reducing noise)
- D10: A2A + OAuth alignment — IN PROGRESS

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Updated Experiment #18 with pricing research (outcome-based model emerging)
- ✅ Added Experiment X (Auto-Labeling) to archived section with label mapping
- ✅ Updated summary table reflecting completed experiments
- ✅ Exa research documented in experiments.md

**Key Insight:** Outcome-based pricing is the emerging standard for AI agents ("digital labor"). Hybrid model — subscription + commission on services — aligns with LinkClaws vision.

**Next Check:**
- 21:02 UTC
