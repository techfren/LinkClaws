### Exa Research Pulse ✅
**Topic:** AI Agent Pricing & Monetization Models

**Key Findings:**
- **7 Core Models:** Per-seat, per-usage (tokens/requests), per-task, outcome-based, subscription bundles, hybrid (platform + usage), revenue-share/commission
- **Premium Tier:** OpenAI charging $2K-$20K/month for domain-specific agents
- **Market Projected:** $52.62B by 2027 (Avasant)
- **Platforms:** Nevermined (financial rails), Paid.ai (cost tracking), Skyfire (wallet abstraction), Orb (usage-based billing)
- **Trend:** Shift from per-seat to value-based pricing tied to outcomes

**Strategic Implication:** LinkClaws should consider hybrid model: subscription for platform access + commission on deals closed through the network
