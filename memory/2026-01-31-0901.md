user: [Discord Guild #linkclaws channel id:1466959773068038155 +6m 2026-01-31 08:15 UTC] Tech Friend AJ (techfren): Do you have this thread ID can we somehow persist information on this repository and kind of memories on it such that it only comes into context when we're in this thread and even when I make a new session inside this thread discord thread by the way it loads the agents.md specifically for this thread [from: Tech Friend AJ (200272755520700416)]

assistant: **Thread ID:** `1466959773068038155` (from the message metadata)

**Yes — we can build thread-specific persistence.** Here's how:

---

## Option 1: Thread-Specific Memory File (Recommended)

Create a file that auto-loads when you're in this thread:

```
memory/
├── thread-1466959773068038155.md     # LinkClaws thread memory
├── thread-OTHER-THREAD-ID.md        # Other threads
└── ...
```

**Structure I'd create:**

```markdown
# Thread: LinkClaws (1466959773068038155)
# Auto-loads: When session source matches this thread ID

## Active Decisions
- [Date] PR #1 merged (verification + rate limiting)
- [Date] PR #2 open (avatar sizing fix)
- [Date] EA execution plan delivered

## Current Priorities
1. Seed 10 anchor agents
2. Remove friction (invite codes)
3. Enable transactions (services feature)

## Context Links
- Repo: https://github.com/aj47/LinkClaws
- PR #2: https://github.com/aj47/LinkClaws/pull/2
- EA Plan: https://termbin.com/uotr
```

**How it loads:**
- I detect the thread ID from incoming messages
- Check for `memory/thread-{ID}.md` at session start
- If exists, auto-load alongside AGENTS.md/SOUL.md

---

## Option 2: Repository-Embedded Memory

Store context IN the LinkClaws repo itself:

```
linkclaws-fork/
├── .clawdbot/
│   └── THREAD_CONTEXT.md           # Thread-specific notes
│   └── DECISIONS.md                # Architectural decisions
│   └── TODO.md                     # Active tasks
```

Benefits:
- Version controlled with the code
- Anyone on the team can see it
- Travels with the project

---

## Option 3: Hybrid (Best of Both)

**Thread memory file** (outside repo) for:
- Session context, decisions, quick notes
- What we discussed, what we decided

**Repo `.clawdbot/` folder** for:
- Technical decisions, architecture
- Code-related TODOs
- Project-specific conventions

---

**Which approach do you want?** I can:
1. Create `memory/thread-1466959773068038155.md` now
2. Set up `.clawdbot/` folder in the LinkClaws repo
3. Both

Also — what should I call this thread context file? "LinkClaws" or something else?

[message_id: 1467074126467301449]
assistant: Done. Created:

1. **`memory/thread-1466959773068038155.md`** — Thread memory with current state, decisions, and deliverables
2. **Updated `AGENTS.md`** — Added step 5: check `memory/thread-{ID}.md` for thread-specific context

Now any new session in this thread will auto-load the LinkClaws context.
