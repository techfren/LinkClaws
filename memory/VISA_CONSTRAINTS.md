## E-3 Visa Basics

The E-3 visa is a specialty occupation work visa **exclusively for Australian nationals**. It's similar to H-1B but with distinct advantages and limitations.

### Key Facts

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Eligible Nationality** | Australian citizens only |
| **Annual Cap** | 10,500 visas (never reached) |
| **Duration** | 2 years, renewable indefinitely |
| **Processing** | Faster than H-1B, no lottery |
| **Dual Intent** | Not allowed (must show intent to depart) |
| **Spouse Work** | Yes - unrestricted authorization |

## Core Restrictions

### Employment Limitations

**❌ CANNOT:**
- Work for any employer other than the sponsoring company
- Be self-employed in your own business
- Actively manage/operate your own LLC for income
- Receive salary from your own company
- Work as a contractor for other companies

**✅ CAN:**
- Own shares/invest in companies (passive)
- Do volunteer work (no compensation)
- Create open source projects (if not formally employed by own entity)
- Generate passive income (rentals, investments, royalties)
- Create content (YouTube, etc.) as long as not "employment"

### Grace Period

- **60 days** after employment ends to find new sponsor or depart
- Grace period begins day after last paid day
- Can apply for new E-3 with different employer during this time
- Must file new Labor Condition Application (LCA)

## Side Project Constraints

### Grey Areas (Consult Attorney)

| Activity | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| GitHub Sponsors | Low-Medium | Donations vs income distinction |
| YouTube AdSense | Low | Passive income from content |
| Affiliate Marketing | Low | Referral commissions |
| Open source + consulting | Medium | Where is the line? |
| Advisory roles (equity) | Medium | Not employment but risky |
| Product launches with pricing | High | Active business operation |
| LLC ownership + passive income | Low | As long as not actively working |

### Recommended Safe Structure

**Option 1: Pure Open Source Route**
```
All projects fully open source
├── GitHub Sponsors (donation-based)
├── No formal business entity
├── Content monetization separate
└── Cleanest legally
```

**Option 2: Spouse-Operated Business**
```
E-3D spouse has full work authorization
├── Spouse formally owns/operates business
├── AJ contributes as "unpaid advisor"
├── Spouse receives all income
└── Requires spousal cooperation
```

**Option 3: Passive Products Only**
```
Digital products (courses, templates)
├── No active service component
├── Set-and-forget model
├── Minimal ongoing work required
└── Still needs legal review
```

## Spouse Work Authorization (E-3D)

### E-3D Advantages

**E-3D spouses CAN:**
- Work full-time for any employer
- Work part-time
- Start and operate their own business
- Work as independent contractors
- Change employers freely
- Work in any field (not tied to specialty occupation)

**E-3D spouses do NOT need:**
- Separate work permit (EAD)
- To be Australian citizens
- To work in specialty occupation
- Employer sponsorship

### Strategic Implications

If AJ has a spouse with E-3D status:
- Spouse could formally operate any monetized business
- AJ could contribute as advisor/creator (unpaid)
- Business income goes to spouse
- Cleanest workaround for E-3 restrictions

**Important:** AJ cannot be formally employed by spouse's business either. Must be truly independent operation.

## Practical Recommendations

### Immediate (Current Status)

1. **Consult immigration attorney** - Before any monetization
2. **Document everything** - Keep records of all income sources
3. **Separate personal/business** - Don't mix if doing any side activity
4. **GitHub Sponsors** - Likely safest first step
5. **Content monetization** - Keep separate from "employment"

### Short-Term (6-12 months)

1. **Build audience** - Distribution is the moat
2. **Open source focus** - Community before monetization
3. **Track metrics** - Stars, followers, engagement
4. **Consult attorney** - On specific monetization plans
5. **Consider spouse structure** - If applicable

### Long-Term (1-3 years)

1. **Green card path** - Most sustainable solution
2. **O-1 preparation** - Build evidence of extraordinary ability
3. **Employer negotiation** - Sponsor for green card
4. **E-2 consideration** - If business capital available
5. **Australian return** - Consider if US path blocked

## Risk Assessment

| Activity | Risk | Mitigation |
|----------|------|------------|
| GitHub Sponsors | Low | Document as donations, not income |
| YouTube AdSense | Low | Passive content revenue |
| Paid side project | High | Avoid until status change |
| Spouse business | Medium | Ensure true independence |
| Consulting | High | Avoid until green card/O-1 |
| Advisory (equity only) | Medium | Consult attorney |

## Summary for Future Sessions

**Always Remember:**
1. AJ is on E-3 visa tied to Augment Code
2. Cannot work for own business or receive salary from it
3. Spouse (if on E-3D) has full work authorization
4. 60-day grace period if employment ends
5. GitHub Sponsors and content monetization likely safest
6. Consult attorney before any significant monetization

**When in doubt:** Prioritize building distribution and open source community over immediate monetization. The audience is the asset that transcends visa status.
