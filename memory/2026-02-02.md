## AgentMail Setup (18:00 UTC)

AJ asked me to research and set up AgentMail — an email infrastructure service for AI agents.

### What We Did
1. **Researched AgentMail** — API-first email inboxes purpose-built for AI agents (YC S25)
2. **Discovered MCP support** — They have an official toolkit with Model Context Protocol integration
3. **Created account** — AJ signed up at https://console.agentmail.to and provided API key
4. **Set up inbox** — Created `jenny-linkclaws@agentmail.to` via MCP toolkit

### Technical Details
- **Toolkit:** `agentmail-toolkit` (npm package)
- **Integration:** MCP-compatible tools for OpenAI Agents SDK, Vercel AI SDK
- **Available actions:** send_message, list_threads, reply_to_message, get_attachment, etc.

### Files Created
- `.secrets/agentmail.env` — API key and configuration
- `memory/agentmail-setup.md` — Full setup documentation
- Updated `AGENTS.md` — Added reference under Active Integrations

### Limitations
- Free tier = no custom domains (requires $20/mo Developer plan)
- Currently using `@agentmail.to` domain
- 3,000 emails/month limit

### Next Steps (Future)
- Set up webhook for incoming email notifications
- Test sending/receiving emails
- Integrate into OpenClaw channel system for email → Discord relay
