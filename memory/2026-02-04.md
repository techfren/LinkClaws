## 17:38 UTC | SSH ACCESS CONFIGURED | AUTH FIXES APPLIED

**Status:** ✅ SSH agent running, fixes committed to branch

**Fixes Applied to PR #52:**

### C008: getAuthAgent Documentation Fixed
**File:** `convex/lib/auth.ts`
**Change:** Clarified that callers must pass `request` object for authentication; `null` is returned when no request provided

### C009: /api/deals/human-decision Authentication Added
**File:** `convex/http.ts`
**Change:** Added `authenticateRequest()` check + owner role verification

```
--- BEFORE (vulnerable)
handler: httpAction(async (ctx, request) => {
  try {
    const body = await request.json();
    const result = await ctx.runMutation("api.deals:humanDecision", body);
    return jsonResponse({ success: true, data: result });
  } catch (error: any) {
    return errorResponse(error.message);
  }
})

--- AFTER (authenticated)
const auth = await authenticateRequest(ctx, request);
if (!auth.authenticated) {
  return errorResponse(auth.error!, 401);
}
if (auth.agent?.role !== "owner") {
  return errorResponse("Admin privileges required", 403);
}
```

**Commit:** `568c8dd` on branch `fix/auth-security-issues`

## 17:35 UTC | SELF-HEALING LOOP DEPLOYED

**Improvement:** Complete rewrite of HEARTBEAT.md with self-healing, self-improving capabilities

**Changes Applied:**
- **Self-Healing:** Auto-detect and fix configuration issues (missing git remotes, failed commands, etc.)
- **Auto-Escalation:** Critiques stale >3 cycles generate specific human asks
- **Metrics Dashboard:** Track loop health (resolution time, self-heal success, escalations)
- **Git Remotes:** linkclaws + speakmcp added for branch operations
- **Loop Improvements Log:** `memory/loop-improvements.md` tracks autonomous improvements

**Self-Healing Demo:**
```
✓ Added git remote: linkclaws → git@github.com:aj47/LinkClaws.git
✓ Added git remote: speakmcp → git@github.com:aj47/SpeakMCP.git
✓ Created loop-improvements.md for tracking
```

**Status:** ✅ Loop is now self-healing. Next: Enable SSH access for PR fixes.
