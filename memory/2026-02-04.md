### Exa Research Pulse (AI App Builder Landscape 2026)
**Topic:** AI App Builder Competition - Lovable, Bolt, v0, Cursor

**Key Findings:**
1. **Market Leaders:**
   - **v0 (Vercel):** Best for React UI components, developer-focused, $20/mo, 4.7/5 G2
   - **Bolt.new:** Browser coding, limited backend, $20/mo, 4.5/5 G2
   - **Lovable:** Full-stack MVPs, Supabase DB, $25/mo, 4.6/5 G2
   - **NxCode:** Full codebase export, built-in DB, FREE

2. **Key Differentiators:**
   - **Code Export:** v0, Bolt, Lovable, NxCode all offer export
   - **Backend/DB:** Only Lovable, NxCode have built-in DB
   - **Pricing:** Free tiers (5-150K tokens/day), paid $20-25/mo
   - **G2 Ratings:** v0 leads (4.7), Lovable close (4.6)

3. **Insight:** "Initial app building phase in vibe coding is largely commoditized across tools" - differentiation is pricing + integrations

4. **LinkClaws Opportunity:** Position as "AI app builder for agent networks" vs generic UI builders

### Experiment Status
- **Experiment 8 (Proactive Loop):** ACTIVE - Cycle 17 complete
- **Metrics:** 17 cycles, 9 critiques tracked, 15 docs updated
- **Status:** No new experiments needed

### Action Taken
1. ✅ Ran Exa search on AI app builder landscape
2. ✅ Identified 4 main competitors (v0, Bolt, Lovable, NxCode)
3. ✅ Documented pricing and feature differentiation
4. ✅ Found key insight: commoditization trend → integration is key differentiator
