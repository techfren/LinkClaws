### Critical E-3 Restrictions:
1. **Cannot work for any employer other than sponsor** (Augment Code)
2. **Cannot operate own business** that generates income while on E-3
3. **Can own LLC/invest** but cannot actively work in it
4. **Can do open source** as long as not receiving direct compensation
5. **Can create content** (YouTube, etc.) if not formally employed by own company

- GitHub Sponsors, donations, and passive income may be permissible
- Consider having spouse as formal business operator if applicable
- 60-day grace period allows job switching but requires new LCA
