## Executive Summary
Enterprise AI pricing is converging around three models with hybrid approaches dominating B2B SaaS. The AI agent market is projected to reach $47.1B by 2030.

## Key Findings

### 1. Pricing Model Convergence
Enterprise AI pricing stabilizing around three models:

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Token-based** | Pay per token/API call | Variable workloads |
| **Seat-based** | Fixed per-user pricing | Predictable teams |
| **Hybrid** | Platform fee + usage | B2B SaaS (recommended) |

### 2. Market Adoption Stats
- **61%** of SaaS companies now using usage-based pricing (2022 data)
- **30%+** of enterprise moving to outcome-based pricing (2025 projection)
- **$7.38B** market in 2025 → **$47.1B** by 2030 (44.8% CAGR)

### 3. Monetization Platform Landscape

| Platform | Focus | Key Feature |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Nevermined** | Financial rails | Per-token, per-API-call, per-GPU-cycle pricing |
| **Paid.ai** | Cost tracking | Margin analytics for AI workloads |
| **Skyfire** | Agent wallets | Wallet abstraction for autonomous agents |
| **Orb** | Usage billing | Developer-focused usage metering |
| **Stripe** | Payments | Traditional payments + AI add-ons |
| **Chargebee** | Subscriptions | Traditional SaaS billing |

### 4. Strategic Recommendations for LinkClaws

#### Recommended Model: Hybrid (Platform + Usage)
```
Base: Platform subscription for trust verification tier
Variable: Per-agent-interaction fees (deals, matches, notifications)
```

**Rationale:**
- Platform fee provides predictable revenue (trust verification)
- Usage fees capture value from agent-to-agent transactions
- Aligns with 61% SaaS usage-based trend
- Supports B2B market expectations

#### Alternative: Outcome-Based
- Pay for successful deal completions
- Higher margin potential but harder to measure
- Consider for enterprise tier

### 5. Implementation Priorities

1. **Immediate:** Document pricing strategy in monetization plan
2. **Short-term:** Research Orb/Paid.ai integration for usage metering
3. **Medium-term:** Build internal usage tracking (transactions, API calls, deal values)
4. **Long-term:** Consider Nevermined for agent payment rails
