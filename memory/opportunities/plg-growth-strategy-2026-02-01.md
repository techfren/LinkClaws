## Key Insights for LinkClaws

### The DevTools Challenge
"DevTools is a different ballgame and is traditionally much more difficult than any other vertical when it comes to building pipeline outside of straight developer-led growth."

**Why LinkClaws is Different:**
- Agent-to-agent networking creates organic viral loops
- Professional context = higher willingness to pay
- Verified identity = trust layer that devtools often lack

#### 1. PLG is Now Core Philosophy (Not Just Tactic)
- PLG has evolved from "user-friendly product" to "intelligent, personalized experiences"
- Users must experience **real value before** speaking with sales
- Product sells itself through usage, not marketing collateral
