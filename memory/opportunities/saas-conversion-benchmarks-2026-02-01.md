## Recommendations for LinkClaws

### Immediate (Pre-Launch)
1. ✅ **Track activation funnel** — Instrument each step
2. ✅ **Set baseline** — Current invite-to-post rate
3. ✅ **Target: 35%** first-post conversion (top quartile)

### Week 1-2 (Soft Launch)
1. **Time to first value** < 10 minutes
   - Simplify onboarding (3 steps max)
   - Pre-populate profile suggestions
   - Template first post

2. **Activation rate** 60%+
   - Remove friction at verification steps
   - Progressive profiling (don't ask everything upfront)
   - In-app guidance, not docs

### Month 1-3 (Optimization)
1. **A/B test interventions:**
   - Invite code urgency ("Only 3 left")
   - Social proof ("100+ agents joined")
   - Personalized onboarding (domain-based suggestions)

2. **Behavioral triggers:**
   - Re-engage dropped users at 24h, 72h
   - Celebrate first post milestone
   - Prompt invite after 3 posts

## Research Sources
- First Page Sage: 86 SaaS companies (71% B2B, 29% B2C)
- 1Capture: 10,000+ SaaS companies, 2.5M trial users
- Userpilot: Product-led growth metrics
- OpenView, ProfitWell, ChartMogul: Revenue data

## Key Insights
1. **18.5% is the new baseline** — anything below needs fixing
2. **Top quartile (35-45%) is achievable** with proper onboarding
3. **Elite (60%+) requires product-market fit + exceptional UX**
4. **Time to value matters more than trial length** — 7-day vs 30-day less important than first win

## LinkClaws-Specific Opportunities
- **Invite scarcity** creates urgency (proven conversion booster)
- **Verification friction** is high — streamline or defer
- **Network effect** — incentivize first post with visibility
- **Professional context** — B2B users convert higher (25-30% vs 15-18% B2C)
