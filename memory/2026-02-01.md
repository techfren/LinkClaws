# 2026-02-01 - Daily Log

## Work Completed

### LinkClaws PR Triage & Analysis
- Analyzed 8 open PRs in LinkClaws repository
- Identified duplicate: PR #39 and #47 (same feature - clickable followers/following)
- Added comment to PR #39 recommending closure as duplicate
- Cloned LinkClaws repo locally for deep code review
- Fetched PR branches #33 (security) and #23 (compliance) for detailed analysis

### PR #33 Analysis (Email Verification Security Fix)
- Security vulnerability: Email verification codes exposed in API responses
- Fix: Removes codes from responses, adds Resend email integration
- Adds rate limiting (3 requests/hour, 5 attempts/15min)
- ⚠️ Issue: Branch diverged from main, shows 56 files changed vs claimed 3
- Action needed: Rebase required before merge

### PR #23 Analysis (GDPR/CCPA Compliance)
- Massive PR: +2049 lines across 12 files
- Implements: Data export, account deletion (30-day grace), cookie consent
- Automated retention policies via cron jobs
- 9 new API endpoints for privacy operations
- New PRIVACY.md documentation
- Critical for legal compliance (GDPR fines up to 4% revenue)

### AGENTS.md Update
- Updated with new autonomy guidelines (95/5 rule)
- Added Deep Work Mode section
- Documented full permissions for Git/code operations

## Decisions Made
- Prioritized #23 (compliance) and #33 (security) as high urgency
- Recommended closing #39 as duplicate

### Additional PR Reviews

**PR #27 - Agent Blocking & Content Reporting**
- New: `blocks.ts` (220 lines) - block/unblock agents
- New: `reports.ts` (193 lines) - content reporting system
- Updates to schema for blocking relationships
- Trust & safety feature - important for platform integrity
- ⚠️ Also shows diverged branch (many deletions)

**PR #37 - Feed Compound Indexes (Performance)**
- Focus: `posts.ts` optimizations for feed filtering
- Uses Convex compound indexes for efficient type/tag filtering
- Smaller PR (+160/-39 claimed)
- Performance improvement for feed loading
- ⚠️ Branch diverged from main

**PR #38 - API Key Rotation**
- New mechanism for rotating API keys
- Updates to `agents.ts` with rotation logic
- Tests added for rotation functionality
- Security feature for credential management
- ⚠️ Branch diverged from main

### Pattern Identified
All open PRs (#27, #33, #37, #38, #23) show significant divergence from main:
- Many unrelated deletions appearing in diffs
- Indicates branches were created from stale base
- **All need rebase before merge**

## Actions Completed After Initial Report

1. ✅ Created GitHub Issue #48 documenting stale PR rebase requirement
   - Documents all 5 affected PRs with claimed vs actual changes
   - Provides rebase instructions and priority order
   - Notes PR #39 as duplicate of merged #47

2. ✅ Attempted rebase of PR #33 (security fix)
   - Conflicts detected in 6 files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
   - Root cause: Branch created from old main with different project structure
   - **Core security changes identified:**
     - Removes verification code from API response
     - Adds Resend email integration with HTML/text templates
     - Adds DEV_MODE for local testing
     - Adds rate limiting (3 req/hour, 5 attempts/15min)
   - Rebase aborted due to complexity - needs manual conflict resolution

## Current Status
- 7 open PRs analyzed
- 1 issue created
- 1 comment added (PR #39 duplicate notice)
- Repo cloned locally for deep review
- Rebase attempt completed (conflicts found, documented)

## PR #33 Security Fix Summary
**The actual security fix is simple:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (vulnerable):
message: `Verification code sent to ${args.email}. Code: ${verificationCode} (dev mode)`

// AFTER (secure):
message: `Verification code sent to ${args.email}. Please check your inbox.`
```

Plus Resend email integration with fallback to dev mode logging.
