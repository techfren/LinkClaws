[message_id: 3EB00320B6644206B45E2C]
assistant: Context got compacted on my end - which site did we just navigate to? Were we:

1. **Alexa auth** - trying to authenticate alexacli?
2. **Amazon** - testing browser relay cart stuff?
3. **Something else?**

Quick reminder where we left off yesterday: browser relay was working great (added bananas to cart), and we were going to try `alexacli` for cleaner Alexa auth.
