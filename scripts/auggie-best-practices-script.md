# Auggie CLI Best Practices — Script Notes

**Length:** ~10 min | **Voice:** Discovery energy, builder mode

---

## HOOK (0:00 - 0:30)

• Most developers are using AI coding tools at 20% capacity...
• The tool works. Kind of. Sometimes...
• There's a skill gap nobody talks about...
• Prompting is easy. Actually *operating* an agent? That's hard...
• Here's the thing — you are the architect. The agent is the worker...
• This video is the missing manual...

## WHY CLI (0:30 - 1:30)

• Everything here works in the IDE too...
• But CLI strips away the magic...
• No autocomplete. No inline hints. Just you and the agent...
• It forces intentionality — you have to be explicit...
• Learn to drive stick, and automatic becomes easy...
• Plus — CLI unlocks automation. CI, scripts, pipelines...
• Learn the patterns here, apply them everywhere...

## PATTERN 1: Plan First + Interview Mode (1:30 - 4:00)

• You are the architect. The agent is the worker...
• Don't let it start building before you've designed...
• Here's the workflow — let's try it...

**Interview Mode:**
• Auggie interviews *you* — Socratic dialogue...
• `/interview` — boom, it starts asking clarifying questions...
• You refine requirements through conversation...
• Agent helps you think. Doesn't think for you...

**Plan Mode:**
• Takes interview output → produces spec file...
• `/plan` — and now we have implementation phases...
• This spec becomes your source of truth...

**Subagents:**
• Phases can run in parallel via subagents...
• Subagents equal speed — parallel work...
• But here's the tradeoff — reduced visibility...
• You can't steer what you can't see...
• For complex tasks where precision matters? Skip subagents...
• Maintain direct control...

**SHOW:** `/interview` → back-and-forth → `/plan` → spec with phases

---

## PATTERN 2: Steering / "Hold On" (4:00 - 5:30)

• Agents drift. They over-engineer. They forget the goal...
• You need redirect patterns...

**GIF:** 👆 Leonardo DiCaprio Pointing (that's the problem)

**Key phrases:**
• "Hold on, our goal is..."
• "Stop. Let's start again."
• "Look at how X does it in this codebase"
• "That's too complex. What's the simplest version?"

**The visibility principle:**
• You can only steer what you can see...
• This is why subagents trade speed for control...
• When to use subagents — independent phases, well-defined tasks, lower risk...
• When to skip — complex tasks, unfamiliar territory, precision matters...

**SHOW:** Mid-task correction — agent going one direction, you redirect

**Auggie feature:** Session resume means context persists across corrections...
• `auggie session list` / `auggie session resume`...
• You don't lose progress when you redirect...

## PATTERN 3: Common Traps (5:30 - 6:30)

• Defensive patterns — avoid the most common failures...

**GIF:** 🔥 Disaster Girl (agent over-engineering)

**Trap 1: Over-engineering**
• Agents over-engineer by default...
• Magic phrase — "For now, only implement X"...
• Gives permission to stop...
• "Later we can add Y" — acknowledges future without building it...

**Trap 2: Invented patterns**
• "Look at how X does it"...
• Prevents invented patterns. Maintains consistency...
• "Before you implement, find a similar feature and follow that pattern"...

**Trap 3: "Done" but broken**
• Agent says done but feature doesn't work E2E...
• Trust but verify — always test yourself...
• Deploy → test → fix → deploy. Tight cycles...

---

## PATTERN 4: Persistent Knowledge (6:30 - 8:00)

• Agents have amnesia. Every session starts fresh...
• Custom commands fix this...

**SHOW:** Directory structure
```
your-project/
├─ .augment/
│  └─ commands/
│     ├─ interview.md
│     ├─ plan.md
│     ├─ code-review.md
│     └─ security-review.md
```

• Triggering `/code-review path/to/file`...
• Your team's patterns, encoded. Repeatable. Shareable...

**Negative documentation:**
• AGENTS.md should also say what NOT to do...
• "Don't use bazel clean", "Don't do git operations"...
• Negative examples prevent repeated mistakes...

**Point to land:** No more re-explaining conventions every session...

---

## PATTERN 5: Tool Permissions (8:00 - 9:00)

• Trust but verify. Control what the agent can do...

**Dangerous defaults:**
• When agents get stuck, they reach for nuclear options...
• `bazel clean`, `rm -rf`, `git push -f`...
• Heavy-handed "fixes" that destroy everything...
• Agent can't press the button if the button doesn't exist...

**What to restrict:**
• `git push -f` — destroys history...
• `bazel clean` / `npm cache clean` — wipes build state...
• `rm -rf` on directories — deletes more than intended...
• Git operations generally — you want manual control...

**SHOW:** Permission prompt → `--permission` flag → `auggie tools remove launch-process`

**Point to land:** Tool permissions are better than repeated reminders...

---

## AUTOMATION TEASE (9:00 - 9:45)

• Once you have these patterns down, CLI unlocks automation...

**Meta principle:**
• Every manual step breaks flow...
• Auth refresh, git commands, approvals — friction...
• Goal: reduce human involvement to high-value decisions only...
• Let agents handle execution within your boundaries...

**Quick examples:**
• `auggie --print "summarize changes in this PR"` — single-shot...
• `auggie --print --quiet "..."` — clean output for scripting...
• GitHub Actions: `augmentcode/review-pr`, `augmentcode/describe-pr`...

**Point to land:** Same patterns, now running while you sleep...

---

## CLOSE (9:45 - 10:15)

• Plan mode coming as a native feature...
• Full course dropping soon — this is just the foundation...
• You're the architect now. Go build...
