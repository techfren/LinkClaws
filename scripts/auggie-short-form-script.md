# Auggie CLI Best Practices — Short-Form Script

**Target:** 60 seconds (~150 words)

## Spoken Script

Most developers are using AI coding tools at 20% of their potential. Here's the one mindset shift that fixes it.

You are the architect. The agent is the worker. Most devs let the agent drive. They type a prompt, hit enter, and hope for the best. That's backwards. The best results come when you plan first, then delegate. Interview yourself about requirements before coding starts. Write a spec. Break work into phases. Then let the agent execute.

When it drifts, redirect. Say "hold on, our goal is..." Say "that's too complex, what's the simplest version?" You steer. It builds.

What can you do right now? Before your next coding session, spend two minutes writing down what you actually want. Requirements first. Code second.

The developers shipping fastest aren't the best prompters. They're the best architects.
