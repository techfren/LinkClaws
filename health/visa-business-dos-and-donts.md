## ⚠️ Red Flags (When to Be Extra Careful)

1. **Client asks for your personal PayPal/Venmo**
   - Always redirect to wife's official payment methods
   - Never accept "just this once" payments personally

2. **Client wants to contract with YOU specifically**
   - Redirect: "All contracts go through [Business Name]"
   - Don't sign personal service agreements

3. **Documentation requests**
   - If a client asks for W-9, tax forms, or business registration
   - Hand to wife immediately — don't fill out yourself

4. **"Can I just pay you under the table?"**
   - Hard no. This is immigration risk + tax fraud.
   - "Sorry, all payments go through official channels."

5. **Social media comments**
   - If someone comments "how much?" publicly
   - Reply: "DMing you [wife's] contact info"
   - Don't discuss pricing publicly

## 🚨 If You Mess Up

**Accidentally accepted a payment?**
1. Don't spend it
2. Transfer to wife immediately
3. Document the mistake
4. Ensure all future payments go directly to her

**Accidentally said "my business" publicly?**
1. Correct if possible (edit post, clarify in reply)
2. If uncorrectable, leave it but be more careful going forward
3. One mistake isn't fatal — pattern is the problem

**Client insists on paying you personally?**
1. Refuse politely but firmly
2. Explain business policy requires official channels
3. If they won't comply, they're not worth the risk

## 💡 The Golden Rule

**When in doubt, push it to [wife's name].**

- Not sure if you can say something? Ask her.
- Client asking a business question? Introduce them.
- Payment question? Her domain.
- Contract question? Her signature.

**Your job:** Be the expert, the face, the content creator.
**Her job:** Everything else.

Stay in your lane. Everyone wins.
