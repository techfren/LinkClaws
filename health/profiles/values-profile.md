Personal Values Profile

*December 2024*

Autonomy

Control over your time, work, and direction is central to who you are.
You resist obligation and external constraint. You can operate within
structures when necessary (like your current job for visa purposes), but
you\'re clear-eyed that it\'s a means to an end, not where you thrive.

-   You want to build a life where you never have to work for someone
    else\'s vision

-   Your most productive period (late 2023) was when you had full
    autonomy with no job or relationship obligations

-   In relationships, you value a partner who gives you space and
    understands when you need time to build

Mastery & Creation

You find deep satisfaction in building things, solving hard problems,
and producing work that\'s genuinely useful. The craft matters. You
experience fulfillment both from external recognition (views, engagement
from people you respect) and internal satisfaction (solving a debugging
issue no one else saw).

-   You want to build software that delivers real value to
    people---usefulness is the core

-   Technical elegance is a bonus, not a requirement---you\'re not
    trying to impress for its own sake

-   Recognition from people in your field whose opinions carry weight
    matters to you

Focused Intimacy Over Broad Connection

You\'re not antisocial, but you invest deeply in select relationships
rather than spreading yourself thin. You acknowledge that friendship and
family haven\'t historically been as moving for you as they are for
others---and you\'re honest about that gap between what you\'re
\"supposed to\" feel and what you actually feel.

-   A life partner who truly understands you feels essential; a wide
    social network doesn\'t

-   You value being truly prioritized---someone who\'s chosen to invest
    in you specifically

-   The romantic bond carries a weight that more diffuse relationships
    don\'t

-   You describe yourself as emotionally driven, channeling that energy
    in a focused way

Authenticity

You admire people who speak their minds and do their own thing
regardless of what\'s conventional. The people you look up to---Elon
Musk, GeoHot, Martin Shkreli, Bridgemond, Casey Neistat---share common
traits: they\'re builders who work relentlessly, operate independently,
speak their mind without filtering for popularity, and produce at a high
volume.

-   You\'re drawn to people who don\'t wait for permission or
    consensus---they just build and ship

-   You value prolific output and discipline in others

-   You prefer building unique things over chasing trends, even when
    trends would grow your audience faster

Freedom Through Financial Stability

You don\'t want wealth for status---you want enough to design your life
on your own terms. Your ideal future includes financial stability to
start a family without worry, outsource tedious tasks, and continue
building meaningful software without financial pressure.

-   Money is a means to autonomy, not an end in itself

-   You want freedom and flexibility above material displays

Health

You genuinely want to be healthy---it\'s not just something you feel you
\"should\" care about. You admire the discipline you see in people like
Bridgemond. However, there\'s a gap between wanting it and doing it
consistently.

Current barriers:

-   Cravings for unhealthy food

-   Vaping (you want to quit)

-   Lack of time / competing priorities

Key insight:

Your discipline is tied to alignment. When you quit smoking for 6-8
months in late 2023, you weren\'t white-knuckling it---the conditions
were right (novelty, momentum, full autonomy, something you cared about
to pour yourself into) and it flowed naturally. When your life doesn\'t
match your values, the friction shows up as cravings and struggle.

Tensions & Growth Edges

Allocation uncertainty

You feel 80% of your effort is wasted or rewards too little. You\'re
unsure which things actually move the needle. This isn\'t about
motivation---it\'s about knowing how much time and effort to spend on
what and when.

Authenticity vs. growth

Your content creation faces a values collision: you want to build
meaningful, unique things (core to who you are), but the attention
economy rewards trend-chasing and hype. The more authentic and
substantive you are, the smaller the audience. Multi-hour streams with
inconsistent returns feel like a lot of energy for uncertain outcomes.

Social initiation

You find it hard to start engaging in social situations sometimes---not
all the time, but the starting part. Once you get started, it\'s easy.
You\'ve accepted this as a trait you design around rather than a problem
to fix.

What Support Looks Like For You

In a partnership, you want someone who understands your motives and what
you\'re trying to do. Support sometimes means cheering you on, but
sometimes it means stepping back and letting you do your thing without
guilt. You want connection that enhances your freedom rather than
restricts it---a partner who gets the mission and understands that your
drive to build isn\'t something they\'re competing with, but part of who
you are.
