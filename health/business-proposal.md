**Subject:** I need your help building something

---

## What just happened

I posted a video on Friday. It hit **1.2 million views on X**. I'm getting high-quality inbound from serious AI builders — not just casual viewers, but people who want to pay for depth.

This is the third time I've had attention like this. The other times, I watched it die. No structure to capture it. No way to convert attention into something sustainable.

This time feels different. I have you. And I think we can build this together.

## The opportunity

I want to launch a premium AI community. High-ticket, low-volume. Think 5-10 members paying $500-1,000/month instead of 500 people paying $20.

**What this could mean:**

| Members | Price | Monthly | Yearly |
|---------|-------|---------|--------|
| 6 | $500 | $3,000 | $36,000 |
| 5 | $1,000 | $5,000 | $60,000 |
| 10 | $1,000 | $10,000 | $120,000 |

That $60K number matters — it's what I need to be fully independent, no employer, complete control over my time. We could get there with 5 members.

## Why I need you

My E-3 visa locks me to my employer. I cannot legally:
- Receive payment
- Own a business
- Sign contracts

**But you can.**

You would found and operate the business. Handle billing, contracts, the legal stuff. I'd be the advisor — creating content, teaching, building the community. When my work authorization comes through (3-6 months if we file now), we transfer equity and I can take over.

## What this means for you

**Your role:**
- Set up an LLC (1-2 days, ~$500)
- Handle payments and member onboarding
- Light admin work (2-5 hours/month)
- Be the official founder publicly

**Your concerns (and my answers):**

**"Is this legally risky for us?"**
This structure is common for E-3 holders. You own the business, I advise informally. All revenue flows to you. All contracts are in your name. The separation is clean.

**"What if nobody pays?"**
We validate first. Waitlist, free content, gauge interest. If we can't get 10 people to say "I'd pay," we don't launch. Low risk, high information.

**"What if it takes too much of my time?"**
The model is intentionally low-volume. 5-10 members is manageable. I'm doing the heavy lifting on content — you'd just handle billing and light admin.

**"What if immigration asks questions?"**
Documentation is simple: "I founded this business. My husband advises on content." All money flows to you legally. No employment relationship with me.

**"What if something happens between us?"**
Fair question. Until I have work authorization, the business is 100% yours. If we separate before then, you keep it. Once we transfer equity (post-EAD), standard partnership terms apply. We can write this out clearly.

**"What if the green card takes longer than expected?"**
Max is 14 months. During that time, you hold the revenue. When my EAD arrives, we transfer equity and I can access the money. Nothing is lost — just delayed.

**"What's in it for me besides helping you?"**
- Shared financial upside once I'm legal
- You build a business asset in your name
- If it works, passive income for both of us
- If it doesn't, you've lost maybe 10 hours and $500 — not your savings

## Why I'm asking now

I've watched two other viral moments die because I had no structure to capture them. This is the third. The attention is hot RIGHT NOW. Waiting means letting it evaporate again.

Also, my E-3 expires July 2026. I need to have something working by then or I'm back to square one — job hunting, no foundation, watching the clock.

If we file the green card paperwork now, I could have work authorization by mid-2025. This business could be generating revenue before my E-3 even expires.

## The ask

I need you to:
1. **Agree to the structure** — you own it, I advise, equity transfers when I'm legal
2. **Set up the LLC** — quick paperwork
3. **Handle the business side** — billing, contracts, light admin for 6-12 months
4. **File the green card paperwork with me** — I-130/I-485 — this unlocks everything

In exchange, you get a business asset, shared upside, and I finally stop letting these moments die.

## If you say yes

**This week:** We talk through details, agree on terms  
**Week 2:** File green card paperwork, set up LLC  
**Week 3-4:** Launch waitlist, validate demand  
**Month 2-3:** Launch paid community if validation works  
**Month 6:** EAD arrives, equity transfers, I can legally take over  

---

## Bottom line

I have 1.2 million people's attention right now. I've never had a way to convert that into something real. You could be that way.

The risk to you is low. The upside is significant. And honestly? I'm tired of watching these moments die.

What do you think?
