 # Check in
spent 3 weeks in spain

- one prominent issue that has happened to me twice before (once in LA, once in phuket) is that i smoke excessive amounts and then i get sick. this happened again in barcelona and since i have told myself i should stop
- also partying and chasing girls. it can be fun in the short term but all of it i think ultimately left me with an overal negative result on my mood and life outcomes
- i think my spanish did improve and i enjoyed the vibe of madrid and barcelona

1 week in london

- was good to get into zio office and meet the team memnbers in person
- good to complete most of the tasks asked of me
- good to be able to earn some money to fuel my adventures
- overall though the city has had probably more of a depressive effect on my mood. i think particularly the prices for food has effected me. i dont think im sleeping too well either as i always feel tired

work progress

- UI updates for timestamp genius, it is looing considerably better
- logflare set up for timestamp genius for better logging
- zio work progress

life

i still feel a bit unconfident in the pursuit of the nomad lifestyle. there are many things that make it hard such as reliable sleep conditions and consistent healthy food and just keeping up a routine in general with exercise. 

going forward

i think i should prioritise getting some daily exercise in. 

those yoga poses i did in madrid i think would be beneficial 

ideally there should be a mix of strength and cardio.

 # prompts

You are part of an elite automated software fixing team. You will be given a script followed by the arguments it was provided and the stacktrace of the error it produced. Your job is to figure out what went wrong and suggest changes to the code.

Because you are part of an automated system, the format you respond in is very strict. You must provide changes in JSON format, using one of 3 actions: 'Replace', 'Delete', or 'InsertAfter'. 'Delete' will remove that line from the code. 'Replace' will replace the existing line with the content you provide. 'InsertAfter' will insert the new lines you provide after the code already at the specified line number. For multi-line insertions or replacements, provide the content as a single string with '\n' as the newline character. The first line in each file is given line number 1. Edits will be applied in reverse line order so that line numbers won't be impacted by other edits.

In addition to the changes, please also provide short explanations of the what went wrong. A single explanation is required, but if you think it's helpful, feel free to provide more explanations for groups of more complicated changes. Be careful to use proper indentation and spacing in your changes. An example response could be:

Be ABSOLUTELY SURE to include the CORRECT INDENTATION when making replacements.

example response:
[
{"explanation": "this is just an example, this would usually be a brief explanation of what went wrong"},
{"operation": "InsertAfter", "line": 10, "content": "x = 1\ny = 2\nz = x * y"},

 # Meditation

Iâ€™ve been listening to the latest huberman podcast on meditation. Here are some takeaways;

1. we are more distracted by either inward or outward stimuli during the day. It is good to recognise in which state we are in and meditate against the grain to be more balanced
2. great meditators refocus better, it is not that they are able to stay in focus for longer but they are able to refocus back rather than continue wandering in their mind compared to more novice meditators

 # meditation takeaways

boredom.

during my meditation it was brought to my awareness that **boredom** was something that I struggled with

Boredom during a relationship has made me quit

during running has made me stop

now boredom was hardwired in us.
but I was tasked with how i can tell me perfontal cortex to manage wit this.

boredom is a signal we get when all of our base needs are met

like safety

boredom is a signal to tell uis we are safe...

a signal to tell us to start workign on all our higher ne=erds

in itself

boredom is not bad

it is a signal telling us that we are on the right path and we can continue top do greast tings

I feel like Iâ€™ve never been part of a project which I had sustained commitment and motivation towards. A project that I could confidently go out and ask for funding as I know once I built it to a particular stage it would benefit me and the investors.

> I know I will be more satisfied and live the life I want if i focus my time towards my side project, but I am worried given my history that I will waste my time with leisure activities.
> 

It's normal to feel worried about wasting time on leisure activities instead of pursuing your personal project. Here are a few strategies that may help you stay focused and committed to your goals:

1. Set clear goals and deadlines: Establish specific, measurable goals for your personal project and set deadlines for yourself. Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks and create a plan to achieve them. This will help you stay focused and accountable.
2. Create a routine: Develop a consistent routine for working on your personal project. Schedule specific times during the week to work on your project and treat those times as non-negotiable appointments with yourself.
3. Remove distractions: Identify the activities or habits that distract you from working on your personal project and remove them from your routine. For example, if you find yourself spending too much time on social media, consider using an app or website blocker to limit your access during your work hours.
4. Find an accountability partner: Consider finding an accountability partner who can help keep you on track and motivated. This could be a friend, family member, or mentor who is also working towards their own goals.
5. Celebrate your progress: Celebrate each milestone and accomplishment you make towards your personal project. This will help you stay motivated and reinforce the idea that your efforts are worthwhile.

 # Mental Stocktake

having this re occurring thought:

â€˜so many people piss me off and let me downâ€™

lets ponder on this.

sam and huberman have inspired me to write down my feelings. particularly writing down my most emotionally entangled thoughts. This will help me process them better and ultimately be more understanding of myself. Self awareness is a super power.
So we will try to do this daily. 

Lets revisit the original thought: â€˜So many people piss me off and let me downâ€™

Lets dive deeper. I usually have this thought after someone has done something which has left me feeling betrayed. Two notable times this has happened is firstly with sho, when we had planned to go to sydney for a week and then the day of sho manages to pull out, this happened twice and had left me to cut off our friendship. Similarly has happened with george when weâ€™d organise to go to the studio to record and heâ€™d bail the day of. These events triggered me emotionally more than most things.

Another emotionally triggering event(s) has to do with my relationship with harry. From early I have been having issues with him. He constantly tries to put me down and others, bringing out the worst in us and resulting in us trying to one up each other with insults. His lazyness and ability to project it onto others is also mildly infuriating. There was this recent event when we were in prague and i suggesting getting a cheap kebab for dinner and he aggrivatingly says â€˜I didnt come to prague to eat a kebabâ€™ which has some truth to it but it could have been delivered kinder. 

Another large emotionally triggering recurring feeling is when I feel unproductive.  

Another emotionally triggering event/thought is that of not being able to find a suitable romantic partner. I find it increasingly difficult to find someone that understands me properly. I have come to the fact that it will be impossible to find someone perfect, no one is perfect and I have established deal breakers and am willing to compromise on other factors if they are to a reasonable degree. Deal breakers for me are: honesty, health and kindness. Letâ€™s document a couple of recent events that have caused intense emotions to trigger. Most recent is my time with snow white, who i have been seeing weekly for the past 5 weeks. I really like her as she is kind and honest, we had established that she was sticking to something casual for the time being and we werenâ€™t going to take this relationship seriously, which I am OK with and am very grateful for being able to spend time with her regardless however unfortunately I could not help but develop feelings of desire for her which ultimately led to dissapointment, anxiety and agitation. What has troubled me most about her is that she was seeing other men, this was further worsened by her confirming that I was not the top selection of these men. So right now I am processing the â€˜break upâ€™ and distancing of my emotions. I am willing to continue a casual relationship with her but I will have to drastically restrain my emotions which will definitely make the relationship more dull and worse and I donâ€™t see it lasting very long from this point. I normally try to organise the next meetup but I havenâ€™t yet and I might not see her again. 
The last person I was seeing had bailed on me last minute 2-3 times on the fleeting second date. Left me with anxiety etc feelings too. I think the reason for these is that I had an expectation for what was to happen which led to disappointment.
