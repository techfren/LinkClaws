 # more thoughts

i feel like i have a chip on my shoulder for all these deep tech people that kind of just shrug me off. i feel as though i still have to prove myself in the tech world to get the respect of the phd level engineers. on a spectrum of pop-sci to deep tech i think im leaning more towards the pop-sci side, which is good for appealing to the masses on social media but i still have the chip on my shoulder and feel as though im being looked down on by deep tech.

- 
- just wrapped up a fufilling couple of weeks in london
- pleasure to meet some of the zio health team in person
- background: iâ€™ve been working with zio health for over 5 years after having met the founder in china during a startup accelerator
- neel had asked me if i was able to help him create software to help lab experiments for his medical device
- I was able to build a web app that could interface with the hardware device over web bluetooth, automate lab tasks (reducing 280 hours of experimental time to just 3 hours) and display the results in graphs and exported spreadsheets
- this software has gone on to be used in trials respected establishments such as john hopkins university
- this week i was asked to extend the software for other use cases and happily did so.
- its very fufiling having software i built alone being still used without issues on a daily basis and im very excited to see where zio health take their product next
- if you think your business could benefit from custom software please reach out to me for a free 15 minute consultation at this link: xxxx

 # Meditation

Iâ€™ve been listening to the latest huberman podcast on meditation. Here are some takeaways;

1. we are more distracted by either inward or outward stimuli during the day. It is good to recognise in which state we are in and meditate against the grain to be more balanced
2. great meditators refocus better, it is not that they are able to stay in focus for longer but they are able to refocus back rather than continue wandering in their mind compared to more novice meditators

 # Writing era

I have uninstalled Instagram and TikTok and plan to replace all of them with creating

Creating

 brings me long term joy 

vs

 consuming 

 is more short term

Writing is an easy way for me to exercise this on my phone.

I should write about my goals and plans

Make videos about these notes?

Penny wise, dollar poor

Could be more accurate about how I've been living than I'd like it to be

 # youtube video ideas

i went viral on tiktok. 1.4 mil views in less than two days
500+ comments on the video too.

- first start with a hook, which should be the most entertaining part of the story.
- mention discord and **community**
- Hey techfrens, Iâ€™m AJ I moved to Australia when I was 4. I have grown up loving digital technology as it evolved around me and shaped the world I live in.
- I loved playing with Consoles, Computers, Hand helds, music players, smart phones. I enjoyed trying to modify the device to unlock functionality beyond what it was originally intended for.
- I also love creating videos. Casey Neistat inspired me to start vlogging my experience in china over 5 years ago. Unfortunately the engagement vs effort for me at the time was not enough for me to continue posting videos consistently. I always had an urge to create more videos.
- lead into the topic of the video with a pun. the topic of the video is how my latest tiktok post went viral overnight and how much i appreciate the community that have now joined me amongst the thousands of new followers.
