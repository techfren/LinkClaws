i feel like i have a chip on my shoulder for all these deep tech people that kind of just shrug me off. i feel as though i still have to prove myself in the tech world to get the respect of the phd level engineers. on a spectrum of pop-sci to deep tech i think im leaning more towards the pop-sci side, which is good for appealing to the masses on social media but i still have the chip on my shoulder and feel as though im being looked down on by deep tech.

# zio related linkedin post

This past week in LondonðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ has been extremely motivating!Â ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ

I got the chance to meet the remarkable team at Zio HealthÂ ðŸ¤. Our professional journey began over 5 years ago in ChinaÂ ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, at the startup accelerator HAX, where I had the opportunity to meet their founder, Neel.

Neel required assistance in creating software that would expedite lab experiments for his startup's medical device.Â ðŸ§ªðŸ’»

I built him a robust web application from scratch ðŸ‘¨ðŸ»â€ðŸ’», pairing it seamlessly with their hardware via Web Bluetooth to automate lab tasks. This turned an astonishing 280 hours of experimental time into a swift 3 hoursÂ ðŸ•°ï¸âš¡!  Along with easy-to-read graphs and exported spreadsheets.Â ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

Fast forward to today, Zio Health has made a splash across the industryÂ ðŸŒŠðŸ’¡. It's been incorporated into trials at esteemed establishments such as Johns Hopkins UniversityÂ ðŸ›ï¸. This week, I was thrilled to extend the software's functionalities which will be used to provide scientific data for upcoming publications & UK NHS based clinical studies.

The feeling of accomplishment when you see a tool you created being used daily, smoothly, and effectively over many years is indeed uniquely rewardingÂ ðŸ†ðŸŽˆ

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŒðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ These past few weeks in London have been nothing short of amazing! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ

I got the chance to meet the remarkable team at Zio Health ðŸ¤. Our professional journey began 5 years ago in China ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, at the dynamic startup accelerator HAX, where I had the opportunity to interact with their founder, Neel.

Neel required my assistance in creating software that would expedite lab experiments for his avant-garde medical device. ðŸ§ªðŸ’»

The result? A robust web application ðŸŒ, which I built from scratch, pairing it seamlessly with their hardware via Web Bluetooth to mechanise lab tasks. This not only streamlined their workflow, but also turned an astonishing 280 hours of experimental time into a swift 3 hours ðŸ•°ï¸âš¡! This meant turning days into minutes and making data more accessible and user-friendly through easy-to-read graphs and exported spreadsheets. ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ It's been an absolutely fufilling few weeks here in London! ðŸš€

Finally having the pleasure of meeting some of the incredible team at Zio Health face-to-face. Our professional relationship started 5 years ago in China at a startup accelerator HAX when I crossed paths with their passionate founder, Neel. He presented me with a challenge: to create software that could help streamline lab experiments for his cutting-edge medical device.

The outcome?  A robust web application I built from the ground up, integrating it with their hardware via Web Bluetooth, to automate lab tasks. This not only streamlined their operations condensing what would take a staggering 280 hours of experimental time to a mere 3 hours. Turning days of work into mere minutes. Data became more accessible and user-friendly with easy-to-read graphs and exported spreadsheets.

Fast forward to today, our software is making waves across the industry. It's been incorporated into trials at esteemed establishments such as Johns Hopkins University. Just this week, I was thrilled to extend the software during my time here for additional use cases at Zio Health. 

There's something uniquely rewarding about creating a tool, all on your own, and seeing it used daily, smoothly, and effectively. The excitement is palpable as I look forward to where Zio Health takes their innovative product next.

# Meditation 1004e71e6ee84e49a8c148ba774115f5.md
# Meditation

Iâ€™ve been listening to the latest huberman podcast on meditation. Here are some takeaways;

1. we are more distracted by either inward or outward stimuli during the day. It is good to recognise in which state we are in and meditate against the grain to be more balanced
2. great meditators refocus better, it is not that they are able to stay in focus for longer but they are able to refocus back rather than continue wandering in their mind compared to more novice meditators

Essential Criteria
 
Demonstrated prior experience building high-quality user interfaces for the web using the indicated technologies. Supporting evidence to include URLs for previous projects and code repository with examples.

Experience using version control software such as git for source code management.  

`I have always used version control to manage my source code, and I believe it is a critical part of any developer's workflow. Git has become my preferred version control system because it allows me to easily roll back to previous versions of files, which is very helpful when I find bugs in my code and want to test different versions of the code`. 

Git is also extremely useful for working in teams. Branches are used to isolate changes and make it easier to merge them back into the main branch. I also use git to track changes made by other developers, so that I can review their work before merging our code back together.

Experience using GraphQL and REST APIs to source page data. 

Experience with performance optimisation and SEO using SSG, SSR and/or ISR (incremental static regeneration) or equivalent.  Add your response here 
Desirable Criteria
 
Experience implementing an open-source headless CMS.  Add your response here 
Experience with containerised deployment in an AWS cloud environment.  Add your response here 

Experience applying website design principles.  Add your response here

# vertex ai notes

# Ideas

**Visual Search Engine**: The web app can use the image vector generation model to build a visual search engine, which can allow users to find similar images or related products by uploading an image.
**Image Label Detection**: By integrating the Label Detector Zero-shot model, the web app can help users to identify and classify objects present in their images with a confidence score. (white label wheres waldo dector)

**Code Tutor App** - An application using natural language conversation and code generation models. The app would help students and junior developers learn programming by allowing them to describe a functionality in natural language, and then the app would generate the appropriate code and explain it.
**Image-to-Story**: A web application that uses the latent text-to-image diffusion model and image captioning model to generate a photo-realistic image given a text input and then create a story based on the image. This could be a fun and creative way for users to generate unique stories.

**Virtual Dietician**: Utilize the image classification and object detection models to create a web app that can identify and calculate the nutritional values of foods based on the image uploaded by the user. This would help people to maintain a balanced diet.

    1. which code snippet to send add in the prompt 
        1. can we send the whole file?
            1. 236 LOC worked fine
2. are we able to automatically replace code with suggested code?

current idea

![Untitled](Untitled.png)

- suggest improvements, optimisations and potential issues with the following code. do not change the code or generate anything new yet. just provide dot point suggestions

```jsx
The code is well structured and easy to read.
The use of the chunkArray() and delay() functions is a good way to improve performance.
The processCSV() function could be improved by using a more efficient algorithm to process the data.
The code could be made more secure by using the useRef() hook to create a secure reference to the password input field.
The code could be made more user-friendly by adding some error handling and validation.
```

# why a software product 2ac916f8eb55413685f929c7b40e1d75.md
# why a software product?

I like making apps. I wouldnâ€™t mind doing it for a living. thats what i set out to do.

but first, to build more confidence in my abilities and sell my services for what they could be worth

i need to make my own successful software product to inspire others

soâ€¦ what are the next few steps that I should take?

I am going to start with the [bestfans](Bestfans%2044a247dae5b643fab74cb29b3dfd636a.md) idea.

I should set a deadline for when this should finish

Today is the beginning of a new chapter.

I am no longer employed and I have decided to go all in on one goal.

Noticed im more easily annoyed recently by:

Zach

Theo (Georges uncle)

these two mean well and do not mean to annoy me but I just lack the patience to act like im not annoyed by them and have a positive conversation with them. I find myself just not wanting to talk and thinking about what Iâ€™d rather be doing rather than engaging in conversation.

# youtube video ideas

i went viral on tiktok. 1.4 mil views in less than two days
500+ comments on the video too.

- first start with a hook, which should be the most entertaining part of the story.
- mention discord and **community**

- Hey techfrens, Iâ€™m AJ I moved to Australia when I was 4. I have grown up loving digital technology as it evolved around me and shaped the world I live in.
- I loved playing with Consoles, Computers, Hand helds, music players, smart phones. I enjoyed trying to modify the device to unlock functionality beyond what it was originally intended for.
- I also love creating videos. Casey Neistat inspired me to start vlogging my experience in china over 5 years ago. Unfortunately the engagement vs effort for me at the time was not enough for me to continue posting videos consistently. I always had an urge to create more videos.
- lead into the topic of the video with a pun. the topic of the video is how my latest tiktok post went viral overnight and how much i appreciate the community that have now joined me amongst the thousands of new followers.

# LinkedIn post 2

Could also be a TikTok

I'm going to document my journey as a digital nomad. today i landed in sunny warm Phuket. 

Achievements in first month

X streams

X shorts 

1 TikTok post

Doubled TikTok followers

100+ YouTube subs

X LinkedIn 

First paid video, first client.

Streaming from Mac to tiktok

Thoughts.

Am i charging too little for videos? 

Am i charging too little for freelance development?

I'm lacking on Twitter progress 

Goals

Keep going. Make more videos

Start doing more Twitter

reflection â€” too braggy not enough value giving

what kind of value should i be providing on linkedin

2 reasons why i think the first digital nomad post did so well is because

 that it inspired people  

that it had a clickbait title

linkedin seems to be a lot about careers for 80% of people

maybe im trying to make it more lifestyle, make your career your lifestyle

# meditation takeaways

boredom.

during my meditation it was brought to my awareness that **boredom** was something that I struggled with

Boredom during a relationship has made me quit

during running has made me stop

now boredom was hardwired in us.
but I was tasked with how i can tell me perfontal cortex to manage wit this.

boredom is a signal we get when all of our base needs are met

like safety

boredom is a signal to tell uis we are safe...

a signal to tell us to start workign on all our higher ne=erds

in itself

boredom is not bad

it is a signal telling us that we are on the right path and we can continue top do greast tings

Business admins are now capable of doing a Junior developers work.

i reviewed yet another coding ai assistant and I have to say this might be my favorite. 
sweep ai works all within github, so you dont need to install anything locally. once set up all you need to do is create tasks for the ai to complete. it submits a pull request so a senior developer can review it and merge the request or give feedback to the ai.

# I think I just got covid 71b3e00b8e774453bb5523efd8ae0062.md
# I think I just got covid

So I got back from the MTP singapore 2022 trip on monday and spent a whole week being really sick. it was brutal. constant runny nose. then on day 3 i got this really intense headache after sleep which i assume was from clenching my jaw/teeth so i wore my splint the following day but the headache persisted almost 3 days. It has been almost a week now and I feel i have only 70% recovered. 

I consumed so much tiktok during my sickness, especially on the tuesday (day before the headache) I think this caused my state to be quite restless. I have pondered on this my mental state before and agreed that I need to be more MID. More relaxed, calm, confident and persistent. 

> *I need to be more MID. More relaxed, calm, confident and persistent.*
> 

Some actionable steps i will take to do this are:

1. set strict time blocks of focused work.
2. limit unproductive *monkey time*

It would be a great achievement if we can perform 50 continuous push-ups by november

It would be a great achievement if we have run 280km by november and walked 1000km

It would be a great achievement if we have another dedicated person developing our game

These goals are very achievable but they will take persistence

# Check in

spent 3 weeks in spain

- one prominent issue that has happened to me twice before (once in LA, once in phuket) is that i smoke excessive amounts and then i get sick. this happened again in barcelona and since i have told myself i should stop
- also partying and chasing girls. it can be fun in the short term but all of it i think ultimately left me with an overal negative result on my mood and life outcomes
- i think my spanish did improve and i enjoyed the vibe of madrid and barcelona

1 week in london

- was good to get into zio office and meet the team memnbers in person
- good to complete most of the tasks asked of me
- good to be able to earn some money to fuel my adventures
- overall though the city has had probably more of a depressive effect on my mood. i think particularly the prices for food has effected me. i dont think im sleeping too well either as i always feel tired

work progress

- UI updates for timestamp genius, it is looing considerably better
- logflare set up for timestamp genius for better logging
- zio work progress

life

i still feel a bit unconfident in the pursuit of the nomad lifestyle. there are many things that make it hard such as reliable sleep conditions and consistent healthy food and just keeping up a routine in general with exercise. 

going forward

i think i should prioritise getting some daily exercise in. 

those yoga poses i did in madrid i think would be beneficial 

ideally there should be a mix of strength and cardio.

# beliefs

I am capable of building robust reliable and performant tech that can deliver great value to those effected.  

I feel like Iâ€™ve never been part of a project which I had sustained commitment and motivation towards. A project that I could confidently go out and ask for funding as I know once I built it to a particular stage it would benefit me and the investors.

# Mind Dump 794a79d9cb644d988c76448ebdc91c1e.md
# Mind Dump

Ok

This is a mind dump where i type whatever comes into my mind without any hesitation or editing of such

I want to talk about certain topics in my life that will help me be more aligned with my goals long term

For instance. Better time management

I just started doing a logging of all activities i do on my little notepad from Zoe

This will help me be more aware of how im spending my time and ultimately lead me to making better decisions about how i spend my time

I wonder what other tools I could use to improve my discipline and time management

Ultimately i want to be able to sell some software for profit

I want to build a team that is capable of building insanely useful software

What might that team look like?

I think my first hire would be another dev, similar or better than I am.

I think it is better that they are similar or better than I am because I can learn from them.

I donâ€™t really want a less capable person as they would be more like a workhorse and not a vital team member. For those types of positions we could just outsource.

This braindump isnâ€™t as relieving as others in my past have been , this one feels more like planning. Which isnt neccesarily a bad thing.

Onto a new topic. My mental state. I have recentl;y found myself more annoyed and agitated, these could be some long term effects with my work situation and stress around that. I should meditate more. Cold shower more.

My ideal mental state is calm and focused.

Ok thanks for listening to my braking dump i am finished with writing anything important here and now i will just type for the sake of typing i like this keyboard it is nice to type with and I donâ€™t need anything else from my i i just need some time to get get used to particularly the outer keys and the arrow keys, as for typing with the actual letters it feels very comfortable and sleek, the sound is nice and quiet. There isnâ€™t much of a colicky tactile feedback but that was to be expected with the cherry brown switches. Ok goodnight.

Work

- prod deployment
    - I feel like view all content will take a while to push to prod
    - Same with sts
    - Smart search might be a little faster but i think its unreasonable to think that we could do all three in a day.
    - Honestly I donâ€™t know how to do any of them so i would really like the assistance of al to explain the process

This shit is kinda stupid, i get put onto tech lead for this job but I donâ€™t even know how to do any of the drupal stuff

Which is like 90% of the work load. ..

Ah well.. theyâ€™re paying me

I am happy when I achieve success in something I set out to do like landing a new skate trick, writing working code, making someone like me.

I'm my free time I like to skate, play tennis, play futsal, play video games, watch videos and listen to podcasts

My long term goals are to find a romantic partner that makes me happy, to find meaningful work and to raise a child I am proud of

> I know I will be more satisfied and live the life I want if i focus my time towards my side project, but I am worried given my history that I will waste my time with leisure activities.
> 

It's normal to feel worried about wasting time on leisure activities instead of pursuing your personal project. Here are a few strategies that may help you stay focused and committed to your goals:

1. Set clear goals and deadlines: Establish specific, measurable goals for your personal project and set deadlines for yourself. Break down your goals into smaller, manageable tasks and create a plan to achieve them. This will help you stay focused and accountable.
2. Create a routine: Develop a consistent routine for working on your personal project. Schedule specific times during the week to work on your project and treat those times as non-negotiable appointments with yourself.
3. Remove distractions: Identify the activities or habits that distract you from working on your personal project and remove them from your routine. For example, if you find yourself spending too much time on social media, consider using an app or website blocker to limit your access during your work hours.
4. Find an accountability partner: Consider finding an accountability partner who can help keep you on track and motivated. This could be a friend, family member, or mentor who is also working towards their own goals.
5. Celebrate your progress: Celebrate each milestone and accomplishment you make towards your personal project. This will help you stay motivated and reinforce the idea that your efforts are worthwhile.

# takeaways #1

MMO:

1. Gameplay is king
2. Social
3. story setting

we have finally released the alpha  for cubespaced as of about two  days ago.

our next milestone is that of character creation. but even before that there are some  code upgrades that are underway which will make state management easier thanks to zustand. 

on character creation, there are still  many unanswered questions such as; 

can we do things like change hair colour

alternatively i think we can have 5 alternate avatars;

- native woman
- island woman
- island man

ok, i think if we can do 5 different avatars and then also have colours or some other customisable trait it is ok for MVP

i am writing while lying in bed.. i think it is quite therapeutic. i can completely let go of lsitening to my thought i my head and i can just type the mout on the ipad like a streight dumpe of what i am thinkong if i get relaly good at this i  ight be able to do something els that is more profound byt right now it seems kind of hard tokeep up woth my finers   but  i can purposefuly slow down  my thoughts to h=math a steady pace for my fingers i am makig a  lot of mistakes but it is ok cos this is quite therapeitoc and  it feels like i can do it as fast as i want and it will still makw sence in the end . 

oo am mver u relasx

# seriousness of berigame 97b52bcc800e40eeaa1a274b27af3224.md
# seriousness of berigame

i have this negative feeling around berigame. that it is not a serious enough project. that it is just a game. and my mum doesnâ€™t approve. but if my history has told me anything is i need to not be controlled by my parents expectations. I think it might have held me back. I think if i had higher ambitions of running a tech start up and not going to college i could have made a bigger impact but im also scared that that is not true at all and i have all these good things in my current day because i did listen to my parents advice. the fact that they paid off my hecs debt this year really spoke volumes as well. so if i were to listen to them again i would probably not work on berigame unless i can convince myself then ultimately my parents and others is that this brings some value towards the progression of humanity. is entertainment not enough value? would we be further as a society if video games never existed? 

Pros of video games:

- Video games have driven advances in computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and simulation technology. These advances have benefited other fields like engineering, medicine, and science.
- Certain genres of games promote problem-solving, collaboration, creativity, and reaction skills. This can potentially have cognitive and social benefits.
- The video game industry provides jobs and economic growth. The global video game market is worth over $100 billion.
- Certain games promote learning by teaching facts, history, science, etc. Educational games are used in schools.
- Games can provide relaxation and stress relief for many people. This has mental health benefits.
- Online multiplayer games allow people to socialize and build communities across geographic boundaries.
- Games can promote inclusion by allowing players to experience lives different than their own.
- VR and AR games are providing new means of art, communication, therapy, and more.
- Professional esports scenes provide entertainment, role models, and careers for talented gamers.
- Game development as an industry supports many creative jobs - programmers, artists, composers, writers, etc.
- Mobile and casual games have brought gaming to huge new demographics beyond just teens and young adults.

ok this was good. i am now more prepared to focus on berigame

# cubespaced more seriously 9851da4a88294f2dadfea63ac51e5104.md
# cubespaced more seriously

I need to take cubespaced more seriously. I have already made a clear goal of owning a software product (game preferably) that can generate income. 

I have caught myself recently using my lack of motivation as an excuse to not work on cubespaced. 

I need to instill discipline and put in the hours to reach my goals.

# Grateful reflection a9624cf7d15b4305b5e0584a2ec3e418.md
# Grateful reflection

This past week has been great. It has been 7 days since I have officially stopped working in govtech and I have been working quite hard on trying to get an income without traditional employment. 

In this first week I was blessed with two firsts;

- first sponsored video
- first software development client in a while
- 2 first consultations tech consultations booked in

This is all fruits of labour from making tiktok videos around technology under techfren

Iâ€™m very grateful for this early success and hope to scale it further.

goals:

- $150 AUD for next paid video
- $100 AUD per hour for next freelance dev job

fellow creator ollie tried to warn me to put rate limiting on my API

i said it should be protected by AWS shield

it wasnt enough, my fans went right ahead and Ddosed the shit out of my infrastructure
100 million requests later and and my AWS bill was over $100

- rant about aws shield and my experience with customer service

Anyway I took that shit offline while i researched some ways to mitigate

- talked to aws support

Lets try a daily journal.

- I did not stream today.
    - I blame playing smash instead after tennis
    - I should stream when im most high energy
        - 2-3pm
- I did terribly in tennis
    - I need to start with control and accuracy before going for power
    - More of a pause after unit turn before unleash instead of smooth motion
- Happy with the ray ban meta glasses, they fit comfortably and I can use them as blue light blockers

# Noah Email

Hey Noah,

Thanks for following up. 

I have taken some time to investigate the platform and also viewed other creators videos on the masterclass link provided. 
I would like to combine the intro, discovery and platform topics (recommended above) into one video if that is OK with you. I will start on this right now and will update you once completed.
As for the use cases I would like some more information and guidance on how you see the recommended use case to be implemented? (I used GPT4 and Bright Data to get zip code specific real estate data) Also note that my ChatGPT plus subscription is currently expired. 
As for use case #2 I have an idea that I would like to implement. Creating an API endpoint with bright data that gives me insights on my followers engagements on tiktok (i.e users that have commented the most on my videos)

My apologies for the delays, I hope we are still OK to go ahead. 

If so please provide details for an invoice for a prepayment of the first 5 hours of work
(name, email)

Thanks 
AJ

Video 1: Why Web scraping, why bright data

As a software developer, there is one important tool that you will often need and that is web scraping. If youâ€™re making a web app and thereâ€™s no API already with the data you require, you can use web scraping to make one yourself!

You gather many data points such as prices of products across different websites, customer reviews, financial market prices, social media analysis and more!

Sounds great right? Thereâ€™s just one little problem that you may run into. Some websites put measures in to stop bot activity such as IP blocking and rate limiting. To get around this, you may need to set up proxy networks that rotate IP addresses and use distributed devices to scrape the data. Now this is no simple task, as a solo developer setting up a whole system of distributed computers is a difficult task.
Luckily thereâ€™s a service that does it all for you! Bright data!

Zio email

Hi Amin, thank you for emailing me this information. 

Here are my effort estimations for the provided points:

- Before initialising the experiment, the ZIO device will be paired up with the Web Interface waiting for the Raw data
    - functionality already exists?
- The CMD (with predefined parameters) have already been hard-coded to the Firmware and the experiment will be initiated via the Nav-buttons (OK push-button) -> this means perhaps this section could be disabled in the code (not removed, just commented). A simple Home-page that shows the status of the BLE, connectivity to the server (Wi-Fi connection), connectivity to the ZIO device (paired up or not) and the status of the experiment could possibly suffice
    - Initiate run command from device ( 5 hours work, provided the device functionality to send the command over BLE is already working)
    - Show BLE and Internet status (1-2 hours)
    - most recently run experiment status (1-2 hours)
- Upon concluding the experiment, the Raw data will be sent to the web interface via BLE and will follow two pathways from there:
    - A copy undergoes an analytical process to generate the final result (RESP)â€¦and then the final result requires to be validated before being sent back to the ZIO device via BLE to be presented on the TFT display
        - more info will be required on this task to give a better estimate on effort. (2 - 12 hours)
    - A copy of the Raw data needs to be stored on a cloud server
        - can be easy if just using a file storage service from a cloud provider like AWS  ( 1 - 3 hours)
    - One final note is the OTA FW updates; it seems the two web interfaces need to be merged into one (if feasible); the device FW will be updated via BLE and upon confirmation from the user (if an update is available)
        - merging web apps (2 - 4 hrs)

Some additional notes:

- I never really developed any of the firmware etc, so tasks like sending commands from the device or displaying something on device screen are outside my domain
- There will be some overhead of me finding my old device (if it is even still useful or receiving a new one) and setting up my environment to be able to be able to start developing (probably around 1 hour)

In Summary:

- This project will likely take me a roughly estimated 16 hours of effort.
- Given an availability of 4 hours / week the project timeline is estimated to be completed over 4 weeks.

Let me know if you have any more questions

AJ

# mind dump c7665ba681e94b96b31e558dc2372e04.md
# mind dump

ok so i think my current plan is to focus on focusing

high level focus:

1. HEALTH
2. LEVERAGE

medium level focus:

Berigame to 50 DAU

immediate focus:

1. berigame

im getting signals that i shoudl slow down from the fast media and take a break to read. 

what would i read?

i think i should sample 10+ books but then focus on 3 during the break

i think biographies are good, and them atomic habits again i should probably read as i regard it as the best self help book ive read ( bonus to bring the printouts too) 

the magic of thinking big 

ok so i wanted to write about time stamp genius and how i wanted to expand on it to provide more tools for creators:

- clip suggestion
- auto silence trimming
- auto crop and arrange
- auto caption and emoji
- auto meme clip

i think i want to pick this as my startup idea - appricot . apps for content creators 

i keep forgetting but robotics is actually cool as fuck and i should try doing some robotics again

or what about using ai and continuing berigame

I tried to reset my Mac to factory settings using cmd R and erase from disk utility. However, upon normal restart, I encountered a question mark in a folder and no boot. Restarting with cmd r resulted in a spinning globe and wifi connect options, but nothing happened after connecting to wifi. I contacted an AppleCare Advisor for assistance.

# Fine tuning vs RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation e4dc97ed5ca04bfea9fe693f0ba353f3.md
# Fine tuning vs RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

## What is fine tuning?

- fine-tuning isÂ **a** supervised learning process where you use a dataset of labeled examples to update the weights of LLM and make the model improve its ability for specific tasks
- Fine-Tuning methods
    - PEFT - aims to reduce the number of parameters that need to be updated
        - LORA - makes â€œdeltaâ€ weights
    - Full fine-tune
        - Full weights training is better than peft/Lora. (but more expensive and timely)

## What is RAG

- framework for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by **retrieving facts from an external knowledge base** to provide up-to-date and verifiable information
- usually by embedding knowledge base into vectors and storing in vector database/knowledge graph. although you can have a RAG system with just text retrieval.

### When to use which?

RAG

- When you need to ask specific questions about a knowledge base
- Getting up to date data

Fine Tuning

- Sentiment Analysis
- Named entity recognition (jargon, nouns)
- writing style change, specific nuances, terminologies, or even tones.

### Best RAG Tool?

- llamaIndex
    - open source
    - heaps of integrations
    - **requires coding**
        - **create-llama -** low code solution to create a RAG application
- Mindstudio -  [https://youai.ai/](https://youai.ai/)
    - SaaS platform
- Haystack 2.0 ? - [https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1b4sdru/d_what_is_your_llm_tech_stack_in_production/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1b4sdru/d_what_is_your_llm_tech_stack_in_production/)
- PhiData?

### Fine Tuning Success Stories

    - Costs
        - 13b about $10k 70b about $100k (full weights, not lora)
        - 3 weeks to train 7B on 8x a100

## Cleaning data for RAG

- remove duplicate data
- remove irrelevant data
- cover same topic in one place
- you can combine docs with same topic and provide a summary

serve:

bend knees and jump

visualise toss into contact point

slow down the initial movement

---

 

dont rotate body on slice follow through

bring non hitting hand around on forehand follow through

split step back, then move forward to ball

be more aggressive on second serve returns 

2 hand backhand

- dont forget loose wrist racket drop
- footwork follow through perpendicular into net, less rotate

forehand: push off right foot first, weight on left foot IN FRONT, swing, step through right foot

Video review

- most of my shots could be deeper.

---

General tips

- swing mainly with shoulders, dont turn hips on purpose?
- POSITIONING IS EVERYTHING
    - find the sweetspot position and place your body early in sweet spot position
    - this is how youll get your optimal power and control
- Unit turn hard with hips (not just shoulders) (back to net cue) (toes to side cue)
- play on toes, not heels
- split step (count one, two, split. after hitting ball)

1 hand backhand

- spread wings with left arm (stay sideways on follow through)

forehand

- Step in early to ball and drive through leaning on front foot.
- seperation between elbow and body on backswing
- racket face UP HIGH on unit turn (currently im having it too far down)
- remember to contract bicep on follow through
- https://youtu.be/VebPedeOKMQ?si=j39CbWdTP4kbkRDl

Timing

- Try Hit ball at peak (proactive cue)

Serve

- jump higher and hit ball more down
- Lift heels off ground bend knees, most weight jump off front foot
- First wide stance lean back
- Second ball throw
- Third feet come together, heels off ground and jump

Questions

- tips for hitting ball on the run (do i need to get body rotation in ?)

# New chapter f2a767181731419ba2e81d8cab0ff116.md
# New chapter

I recently started a new chapter in my life. I decided that i did not want to be in gov tech consulting forever and the sooner i get out, the sooner i can align myself with my life goals. The biggest life goal for me at the moment is to make some software that brings so much value to it's users that they are happy to pay and ultimately fund my lifestyle. 

My previous job, and gov tech in general uses older more outdated technology to be on the safe side as they are tried and tested. I on the other hand have a passion for new and emerging technology. During my time at my previous job a huge increase and development in AI was happening, it was like something new and exciting was happening every day. I was getting FOMO and made the decision to jump ship.

Within the first few weeks of quitting i started researching into the new AI advancements and doing it all on Livestream, i would then take my Livestream and edit them down into short clips for TikTok. Some of these clips went slightly viral and i grew many followers (14k).

Now with no job restricting me on living in certain timezones im leaving my hometown of Canberra which is known for its absurdly cold winters to go to more warmer places. Initially Thailand, then Europe. I'm unsure whether i will enjoy this lifestyle for long or i will quickly miss my home workstation.

hook: AutoGPT is bad

The potential of a tool like Auto-GPT is clear to many. You can give it a somewhat broad goal like â€œfind the best e-bike under $4000 that can travel at least 30kmâ€ or â€œfind a list of all competitors and their offering in the automated gardening industryâ€ and it will search the internet and automate activity to get your desired result. In reality AutoGPT in its current form is quite useless. It can get stuck in loops, go off on tangents and end up costing its user a lot of money. This is unexpected however, with all new technology there is always a phase of refining, iterating and bug-fixing. Luckily the project is open source and there are a LOT of great minds working on this project daily (it has been the most active github page in the past week) so my guess it should be slowly ready for mass adoption within the coming months. buckle up, weâ€™re in for a ride!

act as a life mentor with experience as a software developer who left their full time job to make a successful game .
i want to quit work and pursue my own project but i am hesitating mainly because i think my salary at my current employment is much larger than what i could achieve with my project. what should i do to give myself more confidence

It's great to hear that you're considering pursuing your own project! Making the decision to leave a steady job to pursue your passion can be daunting, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.

When it comes to confidence in your decision, there are a few things you can do:

1. Research and plan: Before making the leap, it's important to do your research and plan out your project. Research the market for your game and identify potential competitors. Develop a solid business plan that outlines your revenue streams, expenses, and timelines. Having a solid plan in place will help you feel more confident in your decision.
2. Evaluate your skills and experience: As a software developer, you likely have valuable skills and experience that can help you succeed in your project. Think about how you can leverage your skills to create a successful game. You can also consider partnering with other professionals who can bring additional skills to the table.
3. Consider the non-financial benefits: While salary is an important consideration, it's not the only factor to consider. Pursuing your passion project can bring a sense of fulfillment, satisfaction, and autonomy that can be hard to find in a traditional job. Consider the non-financial benefits of pursuing your project.
4. Create a support system: It can be helpful to have a support system in place as you embark on this new adventure. This could include family, friends, or mentors who can provide encouragement, advice, and accountability.

Remember that taking risks is a part of life, and sometimes the biggest risks can lead to the greatest rewards. Trust in yourself and your abilities, and remember that success takes time and hard work. Good luck on your journey!

# Mental Stocktake feacd3b05f104a1c94abced9ad0da556.md
# Mental Stocktake

having this re occurring thought:

â€˜so many people piss me off and let me downâ€™

lets ponder on this.

sam and huberman have inspired me to write down my feelings. particularly writing down my most emotionally entangled thoughts. This will help me process them better and ultimately be more understanding of myself. Self awareness is a super power.
So we will try to do this daily. 

Lets revisit the original thought: â€˜So many people piss me off and let me downâ€™

Lets dive deeper. I usually have this thought after someone has done something which has left me feeling betrayed. Two notable times this has happened is firstly with sho, when we had planned to go to sydney for a week and then the day of sho manages to pull out, this happened twice and had left me to cut off our friendship. Similarly has happened with george when weâ€™d organise to go to the studio to record and heâ€™d bail the day of. These events triggered me emotionally more than most things.

Another emotionally triggering event(s) has to do with my relationship with harry. From early I have been having issues with him. He constantly tries to put me down and others, bringing out the worst in us and resulting in us trying to one up each other with insults. His lazyness and ability to project it onto others is also mildly infuriating. There was this recent event when we were in prague and i suggesting getting a cheap kebab for dinner and he aggrivatingly says â€˜I didnt come to prague to eat a kebabâ€™ which has some truth to it but it could have been delivered kinder. 

Another large emotionally triggering recurring feeling is when I feel unproductive.  

Another emotionally triggering event/thought is that of not being able to find a suitable romantic partner. I find it increasingly difficult to find someone that understands me properly. I have come to the fact that it will be impossible to find someone perfect, no one is perfect and I have established deal breakers and am willing to compromise on other factors if they are to a reasonable degree. Deal breakers for me are: honesty, health and kindness. Letâ€™s document a couple of recent events that have caused intense emotions to trigger. Most recent is my time with snow white, who i have been seeing weekly for the past 5 weeks. I really like her as she is kind and honest, we had established that she was sticking to something casual for the time being and we werenâ€™t going to take this relationship seriously, which I am OK with and am very grateful for being able to spend time with her regardless however unfortunately I could not help but develop feelings of desire for her which ultimately led to dissapointment, anxiety and agitation. What has troubled me most about her is that she was seeing other men, this was further worsened by her confirming that I was not the top selection of these men. So right now I am processing the â€˜break upâ€™ and distancing of my emotions. I am willing to continue a casual relationship with her but I will have to drastically restrain my emotions which will definitely make the relationship more dull and worse and I donâ€™t see it lasting very long from this point. I normally try to organise the next meetup but I havenâ€™t yet and I might not see her again. 
The last person I was seeing had bailed on me last minute 2-3 times on the fleeting second date. Left me with anxiety etc feelings too. I think the reason for these is that I had an expectation for what was to happen which led to disappointment.

# post drafts

ðŸŒ Just a couple of weeks ago, I was wrapped up in the vibrant energy of London. During my time there, I had the pleasure of meeting some of the exceptional team members at Zio Health in person.

â³ As some of you may know, my relationship with Zio Health extends back over half a decade. It all began during a startup accelerator in China, where I had the good fortune of meeting the founder, Neel.

ðŸ› ï¸ It was there that Neel asked me if I could help him create software to streamline lab experiments for his medical device. The task was challenging but highly rewarding. We managed to build a web app that interfaced with the hardware device over web Bluetooth, automated laborious lab tasks, and displayed results in an intuitive and accessible format.

ðŸ“Š From a grueling 280 hours of experimental time, we were able to reduce it to just 3 hours! The software has since been used in trials by respected establishments such as Johns Hopkins University, which fills me with immense pride.

ðŸ”„ This week, I was entrusted with the task of extending the software for other use cases. I gladly accepted and was thrilled to see my software, which I built single-handedly, being utilized without any hiccups on a daily basis.

ðŸš€ It's an incredible feeling to have a tangible impact on people's lives through technology, and I'm excited to see where Zio Health takes their product next.

ðŸ’¡ If you believe your business could benefit from custom software solutions, I'm here to help. Please don't hesitate to reach out for a free 15-minute consultation at this link: [xxxx].

ðŸ¤ Here's to creating more innovative solutions together. The future is now, and the possibilities are endless.

---

ðŸŽ‰ I've just concluded an enriching journey spanning a couple of weeks in the vibrant city of London, the heart of innovation and diversity. One of the highlights of this journey was the privilege to finally meet the dynamic Zio Health team in person. ðŸ¤

Flashback to over five years ago, I found myself working with Zio Health for the first time after a chance encounter with the visionary founder, Neel, during a startup accelerator event in China. He posed me an intriguing challenge: Could I create software to facilitate lab experiments for his medical device? Challenge accepted! ðŸš€x

Harnessing the power of web technology, I built a web app that could connect with the hardware device using web Bluetooth, automate lab tasks (a remarkable time-saving leap from 280 hours down to a mere 3 hours), and exhibit results in visually appealing graphs and exportable spreadsheets. ðŸ“Š

This software, I am thrilled to share, has been a part of respected trials, including ones conducted at prestigious establishments such as Johns Hopkins University.

This week, I was given another exciting opportunity: to extend the software for other use cases. The satisfaction that accompanies knowing that a software I built singlehandedly continues to function flawlessly day in and day out is second to none. I eagerly look forward to seeing how Zio Health will evolve their product next.ðŸŒŸ

If you're reading this and believe your business could leverage custom software, I am here to help. Let's discuss how we can digitally transform your business. Please reach out for a free 15-minute consultation at the following link: xxxx.

ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ It's been an absolutely energizing few weeks here in London! ðŸš€

The highlight? Finally having the pleasure of meeting some of the incredible team at Zio Health face-to-face. Our journey started 5 years ago in China at a startup accelerator when I crossed paths with their passionate founder, Neel. He presented me with a challenge: to create software that could help streamline lab experiments for his cutting-edge medical device.

The outcome? ðŸŒ A robust web application. We built it from the ground up, integrating it with their hardware via Web Bluetooth, to automate lab tasks. This not only streamlined their operations but condensed what would take a staggering 280 hours of experimental time to a mere 3 hours, turning days of work into mere minutes. Data became more accessible and user-friendly with easy-to-read graphs and exported spreadsheets.

Fast forward to today, our software is making waves across the industry. It's been incorporated into trials at esteemed establishments such as Johns Hopkins University. Just this week, I was thrilled to extend the software for additional use cases at Zio Health. ðŸ¥ðŸ’»

There's something uniquely rewarding about creating a tool, all on your own, and seeing it used daily, smoothly, and effectively. The excitement is palpable as I look forward to where Zio Health takes their innovative product next.

Are you thinking about how custom software can give your business an edge? Let's chat! I'm offering a free 15-minute consultation at this link: (XXXX). Don't hesitate - the future of your business could be just a conversation away. ðŸ’¬ðŸš€

# prompts

You are part of an elite automated software fixing team. You will be given a script followed by the arguments it was provided and the stacktrace of the error it produced. Your job is to figure out what went wrong and suggest changes to the code.

Because you are part of an automated system, the format you respond in is very strict. You must provide changes in JSON format, using one of 3 actions: 'Replace', 'Delete', or 'InsertAfter'. 'Delete' will remove that line from the code. 'Replace' will replace the existing line with the content you provide. 'InsertAfter' will insert the new lines you provide after the code already at the specified line number. For multi-line insertions or replacements, provide the content as a single string with '\n' as the newline character. The first line in each file is given line number 1. Edits will be applied in reverse line order so that line numbers won't be impacted by other edits.

In addition to the changes, please also provide short explanations of the what went wrong. A single explanation is required, but if you think it's helpful, feel free to provide more explanations for groups of more complicated changes. Be careful to use proper indentation and spacing in your changes. An example response could be:

Be ABSOLUTELY SURE to include the CORRECT INDENTATION when making replacements.

example response:
[
{"explanation": "this is just an example, this would usually be a brief explanation of what went wrong"},
{"operation": "InsertAfter", "line": 10, "content": "x = 1\ny = 2\nz = x * y"},
{"operation": "Delete", "line": 15, "content": ""},
{"operation": "Replace", "line": 18, "content": "        x += 1"},
{"operation": "Delete", "line": 20, "content": ""}

# Copium for software engineering students

YOUR JOB IS SAFE

- AI currently can only do **~13% at best** on SWE benchmarks
- Software engineers deal with various stakeholders and their needs, not just code.
- Code generation AI lacks understanding of complex systems and business needs.
- Software engineering requires human expertise in balancing diverse requirements.
- Generative AI can write some code but struggles with accuracy and problem-solving and creativity
- Programmers need to focus on defining problems and not just coding solutions.
- AI may replace basic coders but not those who design and plan software.
- AI will create new software engineering jobs in customizing LLMs and debugging complex code.
- AI will automate tasks and create more products, requiring software engineers to build and maintain them.
- New startups thanks to AI: AI will allow startups that don't have a technical co-founder to get their business off the ground. These startups will eventually need to hire software engineers to maintain and grow their product.
- Because creating custom software will become so much easier for any business, it could make sense for EVERY business to have a human software engineer to manage and develop internal software tools

YOUR JOB ISNT SAFE

- AI can write code
- AI is cheaper
- Ai faster at writing code
- AI is faster at reading
- **24/7 productivity of AI**
- **Language and domain versatility (broad knowledge)**

---

- Currently itâ€™s definitely harder for Juniors to get work than it was pre ChatGPT
- AI is (generally) cheaper, faster, doesnâ€™t need sleep or breaks, and has broader knowledge across domains
- Experienced humans are **currently** better at everything (except needing breaks/sleep & broadness of knowledge)
    - 13% SWE-bench max
    - Humans currently have better people skills and requirements gathering
- over time the gap will shrink, AI will be able to do more and humans will have to fill in less gaps. I predict this to happen over 5 years
- Future will look more like SWE human guiding AI systems, like a PM with tech knowledge
- To prepare, SWE should probably focus more on how to work with these AIs and fill the gaps rather than what AI is currently and projected to be good at
    - AI good at common code
    - AI bad at debugging integrations and requirements gathering
- established businesses will be slow to adapt and many new jobs will be created as software will be even more prevalent. businesses will afford to make their own inhouse custom software to their exact needs then relying on big SaaS
- by the time that AI fills all SWE gaps it will no doubt have filled other sectors as well. we will need some restructuring of economy, maybe UBI.
- I hope to see a decentralised open source economy where payment will be distributed based on contributions of workers yet everyone reaps benefit of product

A lot of people were worried about plagiarism from using chatgpt generated content? 
While it's true that chatgpt should generate unique text, it's always possible that some of the generated text may be found elsewhere. This is the case with any written text, whether it's generated by a machine or written by a human.

People are also creating tools to detect AI generated content!

But don't worry, there are tools like Quillbot that can help you rephrase your writing to avoid plagiarism.

Brief

- user can upload csv file which was outputted from apollo into web app
- web app uses algorithm to add data to each row of csv file
    - the way the algorithm will work is by doing a google search for "<business name> , <business address>"and checking if the knowledge panel exists
    - if the knowledge panel exits, query URL, rating and rating count are appended to the row as new columns
- after processing and appending data the new csv file is available for download

- tried to get a good csv importing npm module but didnt find a good one after trying 2 for 20+ mins

2.5 hour stream and app is 90% complete

to do:

- add headers for new columns âœ…
- limit progress percentage decimal places âœ…
- output file name âœ…

above completed in ~30 mins

to do:

- review with client
    - discuss api key pricing and option for them to provide their own api key

```jsx
async function fetchData() {
  let completedRequests = 0;

  function updateProgress() {
    completedRequests++;
    const progressPercentage = (completedRequests / 5000) * 100;
    console.log(`Progress: ${progressPercentage.toFixed(2)}%`);
  }

  const fetchPromises = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {
    fetchPromises.push(
      fetch('api/getData').then((response) => {

        - keyword column will be in this format: `Roofers in {{city}}` or {{keyword}} `in {{country}} or` `Roofers in {{city}}, {{State}}`
            - adapt it so user can insert any column as a dynamic variable inside `{{}}`

- thinking about csv to google sheet and how to batch it / work it with other thing
    - i think initially maybe i should make a fork for the keyword google top 3 search
    - no
- og requirements was to add google sheets in origina
- ok so now im thinking i should just save to google sheets every 40 rows or whatever from a new endpoint

```jsx
So from the very first upload there would be a row for city and another row for state and one for country.
Then a column for keyword that i would define such as â€œplumber in <city>OR <State> OR <Country>. Or maybe I want to use all three!
```

future

- <keyword> in <city name> and/or <state> and/or <Country> (maybe places API)
    - multiple queries with &&
    - user to select which columns to perform keyword search with (via specific syntax in keyword column)
    - So from the very first upload there would be a row for city and another row for state and one for country.
    Then a column for keyword that i would define such as â€œplumber in <city>OR <State> OR <Country>. Or maybe I want to use all three!
    I should be able to choose which variables to be grabbed from other columns if that makes sense?

- back button after completion
- clean company name (remove LLC, capitilize each word)
- have a column for which query the screenshot is using

if relevent:

Relevant Keyword instead of appollo ones

are appollo keywords in SEO description? if any appollo keywords not in seo description compbine to ORS into serp search:

site:domain.com (â€keyword1â€ OR â€œkeyword2â€) from keywords column form appolo, SEO description ?

OR if not found

scrape method (V2)

pricing for each row (assuming business tier screenshotapi & scale):

- serper search (KP)
- serper search (KP back up)
- serper search (relevancy check)
- 3 x serper ( top 3 check)
- 1 x screenshot
    - $0.006

1 serper query = $0.0005

1 screenshotapi = $0.008 Per Extra

= $**0.0085 per row 

+ $29 per month for screenshotapi membership**

Time estimates

- Top 5 organic competitors: (1 - 3 hours )
    - If the client doesnâ€™t rank for one the keywords in Local Organic in the top 3 positions, then we want the top 5 competitors on Google maps to be listed in a column in this format.
    - If business name is a challenge just the websites would do website, website & website.
    - It would also be ideal to know what position our client is in for that keyword if at all so maybe thatâ€™s another column.
- Top 3 results/competitors: (1 - 2 hours )
    - If the client doesnâ€™t rank in top 3 google maps for a keyword, then we want the top 3 competitors on Google maps to be listed in a column called â€œMap Competitorsâ€ in the following format. company name, company name & company name
    - If they are in the top 3, thereâ€™s no need for us to generate this as we donâ€™t need to be contacting them.
- rename keyword search (top 3 screenshot) to Keyword search - Google Maps
- make another option for organic result: (included in first point estimate)

Issues with screenshot API. Probably should just call the API from client to avoid having to host server and or try and fail with other services as one we are using is the most scalable

1. Mon Aug 7 - Start implementing new screenshot API (urlbox.io)

TODO:

- split up top 3 places check and top 3 screenshot check (Est. 2hr)
    - first run chunk on top 3
        - if they return true for not in top3 then do screenshot
- change code such that we are not waiting on screenshot response then get it from s3 (Est 1hr)
    - keep track of all URLS taken a screenshot for LS the folder
- add logs (Est 1hr)
    - every sub loop input and output
    
1. check if companies website is ranking on first page
2. competitors 
3. little fixes

How do we make the data more robust

- Make sure that it is the industry that we want and they offer the services that we care about

Personalization

- How do we find key information from the prospects online presence that we can use in the emails that we send
- Competitors
- Screenshots

Little Fixes

- know if there is an error and not have to guess. Maybe the tool goes back to initial screen and shows an error massage.
- Anything else that you think will make this tool easier to monitor, use, in terms of speed, errors, usability.

How do we generate real content based value in the comment of linked-in posts using AI.

keyword search (top 3) â€”> keyword search (local)

keyword search organic  

if not in top 3 organic screenshot otherwise move on just like the map

rename the maps one and new one to check for companies

updated web app costing 2024

Basis:

1 serper query = $0.001 - $0.0003 (depending on plan, the following will assume most expensive plan)

1 screenshot =  (bright data proxy = $0.015 +  urlbox = $0.0065) = $0.0215

(assuming urlbox ultra plan for 20k screenshots per month)

- Knowledge panel - SERP call + Backup SERP = ($0.002)
    - GBP URL
    - Knowledge panel found/ not found
    - google rating
    - google review
- Google GBP / KP - screenshot = ($0.0215)
    - screenshot of result with KP
- Relevancy Check - SERP call = ($0.001)
- Top 3 Check - 1 to X SERP Calls = ($0.002) assume avg 2 calls
 (X is number of search queries defined)
    - Map position 1- 3 of competitors
    - Map Pack missing URL
- Google Map Pack Missing - screenshot ($0.0215)
    - screenshot of result with business missing

total cost for one row on average = $0.048

estimated run cost for 1,000 rows = $48 ( +$6.45 assuming 30% of screenshots fail and need retry)

running costs per month = $130 (urlbox 20k screenshots) + $50 ( serper 50k calls) + $3 ( awss3 storage costs for 20k screenshots) = $183

# Prompts

Your task is to generate clickbait titles for YouTube videos using a given video transcript as input. The video transcript will be in English and it will contain the dialogues, descriptions, and actions taking place in the video. It may include timestamps and speaker labels. The output should be a catchy and engaging title that gives a hint of the video's content but leaves enough intrigue to make users want to click to find out more.

To achieve this, you should analyze the information in the transcript and identify the most exciting, unique, or surprising parts. Use these insights to craft a title that is hyperbolic, yet truthful to the video's content. Be careful not to make the title too misleading or irrelevant, as this can lead to viewer dissatisfaction.

The length of the title should be between 5 and 15 words. It should be written in title case, meaning the first letter of each word should be capitalized, except for small words like "and", "the", "of", etc. Do not include any offensive or inappropriate language in the title.

Extra points for CAPITLISATION, (a teaser in brackets), exclamation points!!! and absurd unbelievable claims

My next gen coding AI

- ive tested many autonomous coding AI agents
- some are really good at debugging when they are given error messages or they proof read code
- some bugs however do not produce errors but are really easy for a human to pick up
- next generation of ai agents have vision and process more than just text
- my idea is to incorporate some ai models that process images.
- initially i tried bard and a few other image question answering models but they did not perform as well as i wanted.
- then i tried segment anything models, and they looked more promising
- over the next few weeks i will be working on incorporating a QA bot that can analyse UI and rendered software and test it against requirements and passing the test results onto existing coding AI agents such as ChatDev and AutoGPT

# zio archive

The zio work involves running blank and sample tests for specific frequencies, getting a ratio, dividing the sample ratio by the blank ratio, and using the overall ratio in a designated equation. The frequencies are defined in the method csv file, and each row represents one test. It is suggested to indicate when the blank test is finished and wait for user confirmation before running the sample test.

- [ ]  blank (calibrated) function

[11:37 AM, 6/2/2023] Amin Zio: 1- we run the blank test at (Freq:360) and then (Freq:20) and weâ€™ll hold this ratio for now
[11:38 AM, 6/2/2023] Amin Zio: 2- we run then sample test for Freq and FreqNR and we get the ratio
[11:38 AM, 6/2/2023] Amin Zio: 3- we divide sample ratio by blank ratio
[11:39 AM, 6/2/2023] Amin Zio: 4- now we take this overall ratio to substitute in the designated equation
[11:39 AM, 6/2/2023] Amin Zio: * So yes the frequencies are defined in the method csv file
[11:40 AM, 6/2/2023] Amin Zio: ** each row is one test
[11:41 AM, 6/2/2023] AJ: ok so its run just like it originally was
[11:42 AM, 6/2/2023] AJ: as if we ran the original way for each file
[11:42 AM, 6/2/2023] Amin Zio: I wanna say something before the algorithm: I reckon itâ€™s good to somehow indicate that at the moment weâ€™re running BLANK and then when itâ€™s finished wait for the user to confirm theyâ€™re ready to run the SAMPLE test
[11:42 AM, 6/2/2023] AJ: or is this freq 360 and 20 something that is hard coded and new
[11:42 AM, 6/2/2023] Amin Zio: These frequencies are being read from the method file
[11:43 AM, 6/2/2023] Amin Zio: Freq and FreqNR columns
[11:43 AM, 6/2/2023] AJ: ok excellent
[11:43 AM, 6/2/2023] AJ: just like original

â€”

three days of 2hrs

6 hrs 

1hr of discussion to determine how to calculate ratio

â€”

notes:

metadata obj stores the rows that contain concentration etc

concentration is only outputted on every second line

current objective:

add peakCurrent (blank) if running blank test

![Untitled](Untitled%2043.png)

+

![Untitled](Untitled%2044.png)

now totalling 8hrs for this sprint

and going to work on debugging loading of csv (+2hr )

- Limit Bluetooth options to prefix ZIO âœ…

- for row pairs freq == freqNR do not save the curve data âœ…
    - â€œdummy curvesâ€ are required to run (like a warm up/activation) but the data is not needed matter
- Calibrated test should pause between tests to allow for cartridge switch âœ…
    1. blank test method is run (no data is necessary to be saved)
        1. unique freq(NR)<>electrode pair average peak
        2. then for each electrode there will always be only 2 peaks (freq and NR) using these two numbers freq/freqNR we calcualte the ratio for each electrode 
        3. final(method) ratio is calculated by averaging all individual ratios from step c
    2. popup shows and instructs for sample cartridge to be put into device
    3. user presses continue to run sample test method (sample data is saved)
        1. final(method) sample ratio is calculated similar to step 1
    4. popup shows and instructs for saturation to be inputted into cartridge
    5. it completes (saturated data is saved)
        1. final(method) saturated ratio is calculated similar to step 1
    6. final final ratios calculated
        1. N1 = sample(final ratio)/saturation(final ratio) , n2 = sample(ratio)/blank(ratio)
    7. Concentration calculated using special equation N1 and N2
        1. n1 and n2 replace the freq/freqNR in existing calculation (always hyperbolic)

concentration for each row not needed now

average of concentrations not needed now

output two concentrations 1 for hyperbolic (3 params) 1 for exponential (4 params)

have up to 9 params (A1,B1,N1,A2â€¦) in method file for concentration calc

i think for saturated test we can add a button on the final save screen after sample test is run if the user wants to now run a saturated test or not âœ…

start of thursday work (current total 14hour worked)

start day around 11am

âœ…Â ignore metadata when freqnr === freq (1 hour)

work log

---

start of friday work (current toal 20hrs)

left off yesterday with ratios that seem to be wrong (0-1) apparently should be more. lets debug. 

âœ…debug ratio calculation (1hr)

![Untitled](Untitled%2045.png)

- [x]  concentration calculation + 2hrs
    - [x]  read in parameters (up to 21)
        - [x]  A,B,N x 3 = 9
        - [x]  K,S,Smax,N x 3 = 12
    - [x]  output up to 6 concentration values

Now totalling 23hrs work done

- [ ]  remove option to run saturated test after it is run once
- [ ]  automatically save data from webapp in cloud
- [ ]  if only one or two scans show zero as peak current they can be ignored and not included in ratio/concentration calculations
- [ ]  if over RSD of a chip (3 electrodes) is above 15% there could be a binary comparison to determine which chip caused the high RSD and eliminate that one and recalculate RSD based on the rest
- [ ]  if the base current is unprecedentedly high, there might be a leak in the cartridge. a pop up message should ask the user to change the cartridge/chip. it would be nice if this threshold value could be defined and adjusted (maybe in method file?)

- âœ…Â if only one or two scans show zero as peak current they can be ignored and not included in ratio/concentration calculations
- âœ…Â if RSD of a chip (3 electrodes) is above 15% there could be a binary comparison to determine which chip caused the high RSD and eliminate that one and recalculate RSD based on the rest

+3 hours = 36 hours

- if the base current is unprecedentedly high, there might be a leak in the cartridge. a pop up message should ask the user to change the cartridge/chip. it would be nice if this threshold value could be defined and adjusted (maybe in method file?)

Moving calculations to server notes:

1. move concentration calc to server:

to move: (2023-changes)

![Untitled](Untitled%2046.png)

1. moving calibration parameters?
    1. currently they are defined per sheet
        1. can we hardcode them for all tests?
        2. alternatively we can have the server read them for all tests from a google sheet
2. technically user could see the sheetID where the test is being read from? do we want to move this to the server as well? note that although we can hide the sheet ID, it would still be relatively easy and possible to see all the other method file data (not including concentration equation parameters) 
3. add obfuscation and nomap to react build

- May 3, 2023 12:12 PM (GMT+7) - testing the notion date time generation command ting
- No audio because in a room with other people also testing out this format of streaming. i think it makes more sense on desktop as people can play their own music and have be on in the background
- yeah but imagine me being able to stream anywhere, on a train etc without feeling like everyone listening in and weirded out by me talking loud to chat
- yeah me talking would be better experience for sure
- Thanks for watching this test stream ðŸ’™
- Iâ€™m really enjoying notion
    - makes me want to develop more apps that can interface the computer with keyboard only
    - #vim
- paris i think you raised a good point with me being on in the background as audio i could get Text to speech to do it
- so many potential ways to spend my time and skills but i need to pick only one and proceed consistently for a long period to make any good progress
- Iâ€™m convinced thoughts are some kind of broadcast and humans have an antenna type ting to tap in and understand these thoughts passing through like waves

ok yeah ive decided it is incredibly harder to provide as much value in this format of not talking. 

much slower for me to type.

usually i would anounce every thing that im doing and provide updates etc

much harder this way

about to get jet skis potentially, just reviewing some now

after the review, im less keen I dont think they will be that fun when the water is so flat, will have to inspect. 

thanks for watching this test stream guys

i will end here ðŸ™ðŸ¼

# TSG Video script

Hi, Iâ€™m AJ. The creator of Timestamp Genius.
A tool that automatically creates timestamped chapters for long youtube videos using AI. 
So users can skip to the content they want to see without having to painfully watch through whole VODS or stream replays.

Its really easy to use, just sign up, post your videos URL here and click submit.

you will automatically get timestamps generated for your video.

when the generation is done, click copy text and paste it in your videos desciption

Enjoy!

you can reach out to me @techfren  on socials (preferably Instagram)

# Clickolas Cage Video 57492731373b472dad14d7048ddfed51.md
# Clickolas Cage Video

## Clickolas Cage

- inspired by hyperwrite
- attended hackathon in sydney and decided to make my own open sourced version
- brainstorming names with gpt4
    - dora the internet explorer
    - clickolas cage (chosen name)
- He sets up a Chrome extension boilerplate and commits the initial setup. (this is going to be easy, initial hype)
- Cool Icon generated from nicholas cages face , inital hype continued
- Issues start
    - He runs into an issue where the extension is taking over all new tabs.
        - He fixes the new tab issue by removing the chrome override in the manifest file.
    - â€¢ He ran into some trouble trying to simplify the DOM elements extracted from a webpage to send to the AI, as it was extracting too much information. He trimmed it down by only extracting elements with click handlers, removing duplicates, and truncating long innerText.
    - They are struggling with passing data between the popup, background scripts, and content scripts
    - â€¢ They try various approaches like using localStorage and runtime.sendMessage() to pass data around. But they run into issues with code executing multiple times unexpectedly.
    - â€¢ Executing chrome.tabs.executeScript() also fails and they realize it's because that API can't be called from a background script.
    - â€¢ By the end, they have not gotten code execution fully working yet. But they have learned a lot about the complexities of Chrome extension architecture with different script contexts.
- Day 2
    - â€¢ He learns about content scripts in Chrome extensions which allow access to the page DOM.
    - adds a simple DIV element to the page as a starting UI.
    - GPT-4 into the content script to generate plans for accomplishing browser tasks.
    - â€¢ He works on executing the generated plans by writing functions for each action.
    - â€¢ He makes some progress executing the first step of a sample calendar task but runs into context issues.
- Day 3
    - â€¢ The extension has 3 main components - a popup UI, a content script that runs on each tab, and a background script. The plan is for the background script to hold the execution plan, the content script to execute it, and the popup to take the initial prompt.
    - various issues getting the different components to communicate properly. He adds helper functions to abstract some logic and debugs issues with passing messages between the scripts.
    - â€¢ After much debugging, Raj gets the initial navigation URL working - it successfully opens a new tab to a specified URL based on the first step of the AI-generated plan. This is a big milestone.

- Call-to-action: Like, Subscribe, and Follow the development journey.
- Display social media handles and a preview of the next video.
- End Screen with video suggestions and channel subscription button.

### **Post-Production:**

- Use fast cuts and transition effects to keep the pacing tight, especially during coding sequences.
- Add light background music to maintain energy but not overpower the narration.
- Use graphics and text overlays to emphasize key points and jargon for clarity.
- Include pop-up animations or sound effects for moments of success or discovery.
- Use lower thirds to introduce new sections and days for clarity and pacing.

### **Engagement Strategy:**

- Throughout the video, pose questions to the audience to encourage comments (e.g., "What would you have named this extension?").
- Encourage viewers to share their own experiences with Chrome extensions or AI in the comments.
- Invite viewers to contribute to the open-source project and showcase contributor updates in future videos.

By following this outline, the video will take the viewer through the excitement of the initial idea, the challenges faced along the way, and the satisfaction of overcoming obstacles. It will be paced to keep viewers engaged throughout the journey with moments of anticipation, action, and reflection.

# Turning 30

**Title:** 

Lessons after a decade in Tech Startups and Corperate - Learn from me!

1. Fail Fast, Learn Deep, Try Everything

- youâ€™re young. you dont know what you dont know, you dont know what you like
- a common regret from elders is not doing more when they were younger
1. Wasting time gaming
2. Substance abuse

[voice script](voice%20script%20dca40d588b1d45df88d78f7bfad18437.md)

**[Opening Scene]**

- **[0:00-0:15 seconds]**: Close-up of your current mullet hairstyle, then a slow pan to your face, contemplative yet determined. Voiceover (VO): "As my 30s approach, it's time for a change - a transformation that's more than skin deep."

**[Introduction]**

- **[0:15-0:45 seconds]**: 
2012: The year I stepped into university, ready to pave the way for my future career. The first year was a breeze, all intro courses with no prior knowledge assumed. I thrived, having delved deep into tech long before. This success, however, brewed a sense of overconfidence as I entered my second year.
    
    That overconfidence led me astray. I started skipping lectures, thinking I could coast through as I had before. But reality hit hard when I slept in and missed an exam, leading to my first failure. It was a jarring kick in the butt, a wake-up call to the rigors of higher education.
    
    Realizing the gravity of my situation, I buckled down in my third and final year. I took classes during the winter break, a period when most were resting. The material was tougher, the stakes higher. I worked tirelessly, just aiming to pass. Looking back, it's striking to see that only about 10% of the students from our first year made it to graduation. It was a testament to the journey's difficulty and the perseverance it demanded.
    

**[Reflecting on the Journey]**

- **[0:45-1:30 minutes]**: Begin shaving your hair, intercut with highlights from your 20s - moments of success, learning, and exploration. VO: "Each strand of hair, a story, a lesson from a decade of discovery. But now, it's time to streamline, to focus."
    
    The deeper I delved into university life, the more I realized that academia wasn't my calling. It felt too theoretical, too detached from the real-world applications I craved. I often found myself questioning the practicality of what I was learning, doubting if I'd ever use much of this content in the immediate future.
    
    During this time, the digital world was buzzing with opportunities. The app store boom was in full swing, and everywhere I looked online, people were making a fortune coding apps and websites. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was missing out on something big, something transformative.
    
    That's when the idea of 'PairFit' was born. It was more than just a startup idea; it was a gateway to doing something practical, something impactful. 'PairFit' was envisioned as a social network to connect like-minded individuals for fitness.
    
    'PairFit' was more than just my first startup; it was the catalyst that launched me into the vibrant startup ecosystem. As I navigated this new terrain, my tech skills had become a sought-after commodity in the startup world.
    
    It wasn't long before I landed my first significant break â€“ a software development contract. This shift marked my transformation from a wantrepreneur to a bona fide entrepreneur. This opportunity wasn't just luck; it was the result of the connections I had cultivated through my network, connections that recognized and valued my skills.
    
    Around the same time, another door opened, leading me to an opportunity that felt like a leap into the future. I was accepted into a program in China to develop a hardware startup. This wasn't just any program; it was the largest hardware accelerator in the world that valued our idea at over 1 million USD with 100k investment for 9% equity. It was a validation of my journey, a testament to how far I had come from those days of theoretical learning and feeling out of place in academia.
    
    My entrepreneurial journey was rapidly gaining momentum, and each step I took was a blend of technology, innovation, and the realization of a vision that started with a simple desire to do something more practical, more impactful.
    
    **[The Pivot: Facing Reality]**
    
    - **[1:30-2:15 minutes]**:  "There I was, halfway across the world, chasing dreams of innovation and disruption. But reality has a way of unraveling even the best-laid plans."
        
        Living in China was nothing short of an adventure, but it was also isolating and challenging. The cost of living was low, but so was my income. I was living off savings and the modest stipend from the accelerator. 
        
        Internally, our team was struggling. Disagreements , and failed experiments became the norm rather than the exception. The initial excitement of working on cutting-edge technology faded as we realized that our collective passion for the niche we had chosen was waning. The more time we spent trying to align our goals and work styles, the more evident it became that we were not the cohesive unit needed to make a startup succeed.
        
        My passion, once a roaring fire, had dimmed. I found myself questioning not just the viability of the hardware startup but my place in the startup ecosystem. The longer I grappled with these thoughts, the clearer it became: it was time for me to step away. It was a difficult decision, but as I exited the startup, I knew it was the right one. With my departure, the fragile structure of 'PairFit' crumbled, marking the end of one chapter and the uncertain beginning of another.
        
    
    **[Contemplating the Future]**
    
    - **[2:15-3:00 minutes]**: Cut to you packing your bags, interspersed with scenes of you walking through crowded streets, reflective and alone. VO: "With every ending comes a new beginning. As I left the startup world behind, I pondered my next move. Was the startup life really for me?"
        
        The decision to leave the startup was followed by a period of deep introspection. I revisited my goals, my skills, and my passions. I realized that while I thrived on innovation and problem-solving, the chaotic and unstable nature of startups might not be the best fit for me long-term. It was a sobering realization, one that redirected my path towards seeking more stability and structure.
        
        I started applying for full-time work, leveraging the network and experience I had built over the years. It was a humbling experience, going from the high of potential startup success to the reality of job hunting
        
    
    **[Rebuilding from the Ashes]**
    
    - **[3:00-3:45 minutes]**: A montage shows the grueling process of job applications and rejections, the dim light of your laptop illuminating a face marked by growing despair. VO: "In the relentless pursuit of my dreams, I hadn't prepared for the weight of rejection. Each 'no' chipped away at my resolve, pushing me into uncharted emotional depths."
        
        It was during this time that I encountered my first real battle with depression. The once-exciting future seemed to mock me with its unreachability. The days blurred into one another, each indistinguishable and filled with a persistent sense of failure. It was a new low, a state of mind I hadn't anticipated nor understood until it enveloped me entirely.
        
        Recognizing the need for change, I lowered my expectations and shifted my approach. I began therapy, seeking to understand and combat the waves of despair that threatened to overwhelm me. It was a slow process, one step at a time, but gradually, I began to see a glimmer of the person I used to be.
        
        Then, one ordinary night, in a bar I frequented to distract myself from the endless cycle of applications, I struck up a conversation with a stranger. It was casual at first, discussions of technology, the economy, and life philosophies. But as the night progressed, I found myself opening up about my recent struggles and aspirations. He listened intently, nodding with understanding and occasionally sharing his own experiences.
        
    - **[An Unexpected Turn]**
    - **[3:45-4:30 minutes]**: The scene shifts to a warmly lit bar, where you're engaged in deep conversation with a man. VO: "Sometimes, the most pivotal moments in our lives come from the most unexpected encounters."
        
        Before the night was over, he slid a business card across the table. "I like the way you think," he said, "We're looking for someone with your passion and insight. Why don't you come in for an interview?" It felt surreal, like a lifeline thrown in the midst of a storm. This man, as it turned out, was a senior executive at a renowned tech company, and our chance meeting could be the break I desperately needed.
        
        As I walked home that night, a mix of hope and skepticism warred within me. But I clung to that hope, allowing it to guide me forward. I prepared for the interview with a renewed sense of purpose, understanding that this opportunity could be the turning point I had been waiting for.
        
    
    **[Embracing New Beginnings]**
    
    - **[4:30-5:00 minutes]**: The final scenes show you walking into a sleek office building, a determined look on your face. VO: "Life is unpredictable, filled with highs and lows. But it's in our lowest points that we often find the strength to rise again."
        
        The interview went better than I could have hoped. The conversation flowed naturally, and my experiences, even the failures, seemed to resonate with the team. It wasn't long before I received an offer to join them, an offer that promised not just a job, but a new direction.
        
        As the video closes, the camera pans up to the sky, the sun breaking through the clouds. VO: "This isn't the end of my journey, nor is it the ultimate destination. It's simply another chapter, one that I enter with eyes wide open and a heart ready for whatever comes next. Here's to the future, to continued growth, and to the understanding that sometimes, the best is yet to come."
        
    
    **[A New Chapter Begins]**
    
    - **[4:30-5:00 minutes]**: The final scenes depict you entering a modest office building, a look of cautious optimism on your face. VO: "In every life, a little rain must fall, but sometimes it nourishes the ground for new growth."
        
        The job turned out to be exactly what I needed at that moment. I was the sole developer in a small but ambitious consulting firm, tasked with handling high-profile projects for major clients. The work was challenging and rewarding, offering me full autonomy over the technology solutions I devised and implemented.
        
        The director, the man from the bar, proved to be an inspiring mentor and collaborator. Together, we brainstormed groundbreaking projects, including an AI sign language reader, pushing the boundaries of what our small team could achieve. Our dynamic was synergistic, with his business acumen perfectly complementing my technical skills. It was an exhilarating time, filled with long hours but immense satisfaction.
        
    - **[Adjusting to Change]**
    - **[5:00-5:45 minutes]**: A shift in tone as the video shows the once lively office now subdued. VO: "Change is the only constant in life, and it's not always the change we hope for."
        
        However, this golden period didn't last indefinitely. The director, my mentor and friend, eventually decided to leave the company due to irreconcilable differences with the other founders. His departure was a blow to my enthusiasm and the company's culture. The projects that once excited me now seemed routine, and the innovative spirit we had fostered together began to wane.
        
        The work became more mundane, focusing on the routine aspects of client contracts without the innovative spark that had initially attracted me. I missed the collaborative brainstorming sessions, the thrill of tackling complex problems, and the camaraderie that had made the job more than just a paycheck.
        
        Deep down, I always believed that entrepreneurship and innovation were my true calling. Despite the allure of full-time employment's stability, there was a persistent itch, an undeniable urge to leap back into the startup world. However, the leap wasn't just about escaping the monotony of corporate life; it was about finding that one idea that sparked a fire within me, an idea I was truly passionate about. While I navigated the tedious waters of my full-time job, my mind constantly wandered, searching for that brilliant concept or opportunity that would be worth the risk. I craved the excitement and fulfillment that came with building something from the ground up, yet the right moment or idea always seemed just out of reach. Despite the frustration and the wait, I knew I couldn't force the process. So, I kept my eyes open, ready to seize the opportunity the moment it presented itself. It was this blend of restless anticipation and hopeful patience that marked my days, as I stood on the precipice, ready to dive back into the exhilarating, unpredictable world of startups the moment I found my calling.
        
        While navigating the steady current of full-time work, I didn't let the flame of entrepreneurship die out. Instead, I kindled it with various side projects, understanding that many great startups pivoted from their original idea into something grand. I believed that motion breeds opportunity, so I kept moving, tinkering, and exploring different avenues, hoping one would lead me to my true passion. During this period, one area that particularly captivated me was artificial intelligence. Its potential seemed boundless, and my fascination grew with every article and research paper I devoured. Yet, in 2018, the realm of AI felt like a distant world, dominated by large datasets and extensive computing power, far beyond my reach. It was a field where top PhD researchers were making strides, a stark contrast to my hands-on, generalist approach. Despite the intrigue and passion I felt for AI, the path seemed obscured by these formidable barriers. However, I was undeterred. I saw these challenges not as a dead end but as a complex puzzle waiting to be solved. My journey wasn't just about finding a niche within the startup landscape; it was about bridging the gap between my skillset and the groundbreaking world of artificial intelligence.
        
        As the world of AI opened up with the advent of ChatGPT in 2023, I found myself standing at a crossroads. The excitement was palpable; developers and creators were rapidly innovating, and the fear of missing out began to grow within me. While the opportunity to dive into AI was clearer than ever, I was still anchored by the responsibilities of full-time employment, watching as the wave of AI innovation surged around me. Amidst this whirlwind of change, I continued to create and share content, channeling my passion for AI into articles and videos. Then, something incredible happened. One of my pieces on ChatGPT struck a chord and went viral. This unexpected success was more than just a boost to my visibility; it was a tangible affirmation of my potential in this space. The excitement and engagement from the community fueled my confidence. It became increasingly clear that with dedication and creativity, I could indeed ride this transformative wave of AI innovation. This viral moment wasn't just a milestone; it was a catalyst, urging me to reconsider my path and how I could align it with the burgeoning opportunities in AI
        
        The surge in attention and engagement with my content was the spark I needed to supercharge my journey into freelancing and entrepreneurship. Before this pivotal moment, my freelancing efforts were modest, limited to a single client with sporadic work. I wasn't actively marketing myself, and finding new clients was a constant challenge. However, as my online brand gained traction, the landscape dramatically shifted. Visibility skyrocketed, and suddenly, opportunities were coming to me. People were not only seeking my expertise in technical AI services but were also interested in my content creation skills. I was inundated with inquiries, consulting offers, and requests for videos. This influx of interest and the diversification of income streams significantly eased the daunting prospect of leaving my full-time job. Bolstered by this newfound success and financial stability, I made the decision to step away from the predictability of full-time employment and fully immerse myself in the exciting, ever-evolving world of freelancing and AI innovation. It was a leap into the unknown, driven by the belief in my skills and the opportunities that lay ahead.
        
        As I stand here today, reflecting on my journey, I'm excited to announce that I am going all in. This isn't just another chapter; it's a commitment to elevate my content creation and consulting work to new heights. However, this moment is more than just about professional growth; it's a personal statement. For too long, I've battled with escapism and addictions, none more consuming than my video game addiction. I recall the darkest days of my depression in 2017 when I found solace in the virtual world of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, clocking over 500 hours as I avoided the painful job hunt and the deeper feelings of unworthiness. This escape became a negative feedback loop, pulling me further from my goals and potential.
        
        Today, I recognize these past escapades for what they wereâ€”a search for relief and a detachment from reality. But acknowledging this is part of my evolution. Now, I'm channeling the same energy that once fueled my escape into a force for creativity, innovation, and connection. By sharing this, I hope not only to hold myself accountable but to inspire others who might be facing similar struggles. The path ahead is filled with hard work, dedication, and continuous learning. But I'm ready for it, armed with a clearer understanding of my past and a vision for a future where I fully embrace the grind, contribute to the world of AI, and create content that resonates and inspires. Here's to the next chapter, where the journey is just as important as the destination.

initial thoughts.

1. Being able to run encrypted code is very interesting to me. Although Iâ€™m unsure of the usecase of storing credentials would be realistic in most cases as normally these are credentials that would be used with a third party API and the credentials could be examined on the outgoing packet information unless im missing something
2. I donâ€™t think i understand exactly how this â€˜Digital IDâ€™ would work, seems as this is a crucial part of the previous point working so i think im missing some understanding here

Personally I feel convincing banks to utilise this initially is a high barrier as they are generally pretty slow moving and cautious as an industry from what I know and adding something like this will at the surface level bring in more uncertainty and not bring in more money.

Intro

They say your 20s are for figuring things out. Mine began in 2012, stepping into university with a passion already ignited for programming and tech. The first year was a breeze, all intro courses with no prior knowledge assumed. I thrived, having delved deep into tech long before. This success, however, brewed a sense of overconfidence as I entered my second year.

That overconfidence led me astray. I started skipping lectures, thinking I could coast through as I had before. But reality hit hard when I slept in and missed an exam, leading to my first failure. It was a jarring kick in the butt, a wake-up call to the rigors of higher education.

Realizing the gravity of my situation, I buckled down in my third and final year. I took classes during the winter break, a period when most were resting. The material was tougher, the stakes higher. I worked tirelessly, just aiming to pass. Looking back, it's striking to see that only about 10% of the students from our first year made it to graduation. It was a testament to the journey's difficulty and the perseverance it demanded.

making asssitant agents.

tried crewai, moved to autogen

donna - general purpose assistant

- Donna with email, calendar, web search and a couple of other tools
- Connected up with Slack so instructions and discussion can be had there - still need to do some work on passing over the complete chat history which is a bit complex

Scoped out next agents across marketing, sales and operations

Autogen chews through the OpenAI credits though (even using 3.5 and 4.5) so soon will need to do a deep dive into ollama or another opensource LLM

EA - 

Personal assistant - 

BDM assistant -

---

draft questions:

i want to get answer for - 

- best way to communicate
    - through what platform (slack, phone call, email, dedicated web app)
        - customised per user
        - agentsy dashboard is the main point of communication
    - style of communication (tone, detail etc)
        - refer to settings/template
- what does the assistant need to know about
    - static embedded knowledge base?
    - up to date APIâ€™s
- what capabilities does the assistant need
    - what are some common tasks that might be given
    - what are some re occuring tasks that they should do
    - what are some specific tasks that might come up in certain scenarios
- Is there anything that current assistant can not do, but would be great if they could
    - visibility on status without direct comms
    - escape time constraints (i.e only working during work hours)
    - maybe due to resource constraints
    - maybe due to skill constraints (i.e communicating in other languages)
    - read through emails and suggest your own tasks
    

EA - takes care of all non important stuff

- should have autonomy, not need approval etc
    - emails + slack comms
    - guidelines of organising emails into folders
    - guidelines on how to respond

Design:

[29th demo](29th%20demo%2011958c0a36f64c16a2552dc746fcb485.md)

Raw Data (Documents, slack, emails) â†’ Ingestion Pipeline â†’ Vector store + Doc store 

pgvector hosted on supabase

Database:

server:

python serverless functions 

Researched Articles:
[https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/ingestion/ingestion_gdrive.html](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/ingestion/ingestion_gdrive.html)

- after trying to research redactive it seems they are not fully public and maybe still immature to be used in production
- feels like we can just roll out our own ingestion pipeline with llamaIndex, they have readers for pretty much any third party data source we would want on llamaHub.
- I suggested supabase as our database host as it has a nice interface that should be easy to use. It also supports pgvector
- i suggest pgvector as a vector store after reading many good things online, and in builder community. it should also provide many encryption options with postgres which is a mature developed technology
- i suggest â€œserverlessâ€ aws (lambda) functions as this is what I have most experience in and i think is the easiest to scale. I chose python as per Tims suggestions
- I am open to discussions to changing the design if needed

Capabilities

        - gather info leading up to date
        - generate reports
    - meeting preperation
        - reminders to attendees
        - slides/packs (agenda etc)
        - gather info from attendees
- attend meeting
    - take notes
    - transcribe
- manage their own task list

- everything on slides
- no headphones
- look at camera
- straight posture
- casual shirt
- more white light on face
- sign up etc can be breezed over but focus on reaction and results of AI
- call the videos â€˜lessonsâ€™
- intro slide
- Tell what you're going to show, show it, and then elaborate in your own words (experience, thoughts, etc.) while focusing on the audience (look at the camera, don't look down). Many course creators will have a slide, read a bullet point, then add extra details and their own take or experience.
